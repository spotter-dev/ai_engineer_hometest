WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:00.605
Okay, perfect.

2
00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:02.005
So he's here. Um,

3
00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:03.685
and like Natasha mentioned,

4
00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:05.645
we're gonna make everybody panelists so

5
00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:08.365
that you'll have the opportunity to actually talk to Hayden,

6
00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:09.645
because he would love to talk to you guys.

7
00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:13.005
So, um, she's gonna be doing that right now.

8
00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:14.525
But, hi Hayden, how are you?

9
00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:16.205
I'm doing really great. How are you doing?

10
00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:20.285
I'm good. We are so excited to hear your, um,

11
00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:21.485
webinar for today.

12
00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:25.005
Um, so for everyone in the room, my name is esy.

13
00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:27.285
I'm a creative success manager here at Spotter,

14
00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:28.765
working directly with creators,

15
00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:30.365
but then also working with Spotter Studio.

16
00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:32.245
And I know most of you guys came here

17
00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:34.325
through Spotter Studio, and I,

18
00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:38.645
I'm pretty sure you guys know Hayden already, so I see,

19
00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:40.965
I see Natasha's making people, panelists love that.

20
00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:43.125
But so yeah, I know you guys know Hayden already,

21
00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.445
but I would love to give my little

22
00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:45.725
introduction of Hayden as well.

23
00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:49.445
So, Hayden is an award-winning video editor, celebrated

24
00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:51.085
for his innovative storytelling

25
00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:52.805
and transformative editing style

26
00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:55.605
with over a decade experience, he has collaborated

27
00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:57.005
with top creators such as Mr.

28
00:00:57.055 --> 00:01:00.765
Beast, Logan Paul, mark Rober, Michelle Carre,

29
00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:04.365
just honestly, just the whole, whole plethora of them,

30
00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:07.525
the top people, helping them, uh, cultivate

31
00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:10.765
and craft engaging emotionally resonant content

32
00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:12.365
that captivates millions.

33
00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:16.925
Um, so we know Hayden also won a 2020 streaming award

34
00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:18.605
for best editing.

35
00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:22.405
Uh, and Hayden emphasizes narrative, the narrative power

36
00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:25.045
of editing, blending timeless cinematic principles

37
00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:26.365
with modern YouTube techniques.

38
00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:28.045
And I think the way that you do it,

39
00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:29.365
Hayden, is just so amazing.

40
00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:32.165
So I just love the fact that you've been able to think

41
00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:34.925
through modern YouTube techniques

42
00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:38.405
and combine that with, you know, traditional Hollywood stuff

43
00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.405
and, and make it what it is today.

44
00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:44.005
So I'm really excited for you to walk everyone through your

45
00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:46.085
masterclass and how you think

46
00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:48.245
through storytelling and editing. Yeah,

47
00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:51.205
Well, I've just, you've said, uh, please,

48
00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:53.085
my ego can only be so inflated.

49
00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:54.445
Like, I think that was Thank you.

50
00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:57.525
Thank you so much for that. I think it's, it's, uh, I think

51
00:01:57.525 --> 00:01:59.565
that's always been the, uh, the angle of everything

52
00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:03.645
that I've been doing where it's, uh, trying to you, we,

53
00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:05.045
we often forget that Hollywood has existed

54
00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:06.245
for a hundred years, and we, um,

55
00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:08.165
and the web industry only existed for 20 years.

56
00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:09.925
Uh, probably not even that.

57
00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:13.245
And so it's, these guys have figured out so much,

58
00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:15.205
but yet also they're stuck in their ways.

59
00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:17.325
And so I've always been questioning what could we,

60
00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:19.645
what could we do as modernizing while also taking the

61
00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:20.725
lessons that they've already learned?

62
00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:23.005
And then how can we then improve it

63
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:24.365
and then make it refreshing in our,

64
00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:25.845
in our context. So yeah, thank you.

65
00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:28.845
Yes, of course. You do a phenomenal job at that.

66
00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:30.605
So I know everyone in this room

67
00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:33.925
and I'm so excited to just hear you go into it more today.

68
00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:36.285
Okay. I mean, yeah. Should I get started?

69
00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:38.965
Yes, please. All right. The floor is yours.

70
00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:41.005
So, uh, I think it was,

71
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:43.285
despite the fact we've called this a webinar, I also kind of

72
00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:45.405
also kind of wanted this to be a bit more

73
00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:46.765
of a open discussion.

74
00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:48.725
And I wanted to give you guys some insight

75
00:02:48.745 --> 00:02:51.445
and thoughts into where things are changing,

76
00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:54.925
how they are changing, and where we are moving to next.

77
00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:58.965
And I think one of the most important things

78
00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:00.685
that I think you a lot of you guys to understand

79
00:03:01.225 --> 00:03:05.295
is we are now entering this new phase when

80
00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:11.145
Gen Z and younger audiences do not care for Netflix.

81
00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:14.185
They do not care for HBO, they don't particularly care for,

82
00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:18.745
um, what they're doing in traditional television,

83
00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.865
but yet they're tuning much more into the

84
00:03:20.865 --> 00:03:21.905
content that we are creating.

85
00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:26.825
And that is actually quite scary to finally admit,

86
00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:29.345
because this is something that I saw coming 20 years ago,

87
00:03:29.725 --> 00:03:34.665
uh, even for me, um, in 2010, I believe, uh,

88
00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:38.705
uh, that was when, uh, even no, even in 2005 when I started

89
00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:41.265
discovering creators on the first,

90
00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:42.545
what I would call the first generation

91
00:03:42.545 --> 00:03:44.465
of creators on YouTube, back when YouTube was a dating

92
00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:46.145
website, why a 15-year-old

93
00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:47.305
is signing up to a dating website.

94
00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:50.145
Let's not talk about that. But, um, there was,

95
00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:53.305
but this was when I started seeing, um, the first video

96
00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:57.735
that I saw was this creator called Charlie Salike,

97
00:03:57.795 --> 00:03:59.855
and they just made a parody video of

98
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.015
how to make a cup of tea.

99
00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:02.535
And I thought that was one

100
00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:03.975
of the most original things I'd ever seen.

101
00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:05.575
And that was my moment. And when I realized

102
00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:07.015
where this industry's going to be,

103
00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:10.175
and that's why I went all in on this while also studying

104
00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:11.215
to become a filmmaker.

105
00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:13.775
And I thought this is going to be that happy medium.

106
00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:17.815
And I think a lot of us as creators are kind

107
00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:21.855
of seeing the same thing when, to an extent,

108
00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:23.335
when we're seeing these influencers

109
00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:24.935
and we're seeing these people doing these amazing things

110
00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:27.575
online, we are being inspired in the same way

111
00:04:27.575 --> 00:04:29.175
that I get inspired when I'm in seeing some

112
00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:31.335
of these massive film director, film directors.

113
00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:35.415
And so when we identify ourselves as creators,

114
00:04:35.695 --> 00:04:37.095
I actually do think that's the wrong word.

115
00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:41.815
I identify as ourselves as, um, filmmakers.

116
00:04:42.035 --> 00:04:44.655
That's the actual hot take word, by the way.

117
00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:46.895
Also, guys, uh, since this is an open discussion,

118
00:04:46.935 --> 00:04:48.895
I want you guys to also be sharing your thoughts in the

119
00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.935
comments as well as I talk about you guys

120
00:04:50.995 --> 00:04:52.895
and sharing where I am in a lot of this.

121
00:04:53.195 --> 00:04:55.335
And we could be having those conversations about this.

122
00:04:56.315 --> 00:05:00.915
So backtracking this a little bit, the

123
00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:03.955
what, why has everything changed so quickly?

124
00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:06.035
And it simply is,

125
00:05:07.285 --> 00:05:11.955
there is a massive inflection point when content demand was

126
00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.595
so huge, uh, during Covid

127
00:05:15.135 --> 00:05:17.595
and during the pandemic, uh, when everyone was home

128
00:05:17.735 --> 00:05:19.635
and we all needed some form of entertainment.

129
00:05:20.055 --> 00:05:24.395
And then off we go, uh, Netflix, Disney Plus,

130
00:05:25.055 --> 00:05:27.675
all of those, they couldn't do it.

131
00:05:27.835 --> 00:05:29.195
They could not keep up. Uh,

132
00:05:29.655 --> 00:05:31.795
of course they had their entire massive back catalog.

133
00:05:32.095 --> 00:05:34.275
I'm pretty sure I watched the office three times

134
00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:35.755
during the entire pandemic.

135
00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:38.075
But part

136
00:05:38.075 --> 00:05:39.515
of it is we actually wanted something

137
00:05:39.575 --> 00:05:40.635
new towards the future.

138
00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:44.195
And creators were the people who were able to make something

139
00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:46.715
as soon as possible and get it out.

140
00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:49.355
Uh, and also just making it homely and entertaining.

141
00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:51.915
We missed a bit more of a deeper connection with people

142
00:05:51.915 --> 00:05:53.835
because we were all isolated away.

143
00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:56.275
And so when suddenly when streamers and vloggers

144
00:05:56.275 --> 00:05:58.005
and everyone else was able to give a bit more

145
00:05:58.005 --> 00:05:59.005
of a personal experience,

146
00:05:59.515 --> 00:06:01.685
that content became far more desirable.

147
00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:04.905
And because of that, our industry is

148
00:06:05.505 --> 00:06:09.145
absolutely ballooned in scale because of the demand

149
00:06:09.405 --> 00:06:11.625
and the authenticity that we were able to provide.

150
00:06:12.085 --> 00:06:16.305
But then on top of this, uh, the mistake became this

151
00:06:16.995 --> 00:06:20.105
since we knew people were a little bit emotionally, uh,

152
00:06:20.465 --> 00:06:22.065
unstable during Covid, uh,

153
00:06:22.285 --> 00:06:24.265
and knowing that they're needing the next hit

154
00:06:24.265 --> 00:06:27.385
and the next fix soon as possible, that dev

155
00:06:27.535 --> 00:06:30.425
that then made us hyper aware of what we call retention.

156
00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:32.745
And then knowing

157
00:06:32.745 --> 00:06:34.545
that people are gonna stop on WhatsApp watching,

158
00:06:34.635 --> 00:06:36.545
we're throwing them, make sure you stay to the end

159
00:06:36.545 --> 00:06:37.785
of the video because this is happening.

160
00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:39.785
And then we start throwing all of these subtitles at them,

161
00:06:39.785 --> 00:06:42.225
and then we start editing So bloody fast

162
00:06:42.575 --> 00:06:44.545
because we became insecure

163
00:06:44.545 --> 00:06:46.345
that these people are gonna stop watching our videos.

164
00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:50.305
And that actually created what you guys all know is

165
00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:54.345
the worst time of YouTube that I've ever known

166
00:06:55.455 --> 00:06:57.385
made me mad, made me miserable

167
00:06:57.385 --> 00:06:59.465
that people became such insecure filmmakers.

168
00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:02.745
But that's okay because we actually needed to learn

169
00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:04.865
using retention and data

170
00:07:05.245 --> 00:07:06.785
and information in our own experiences,

171
00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.345
how we can be better filmmakers.

172
00:07:08.365 --> 00:07:11.505
And this is something that I called out free years ago

173
00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:16.585
and people have been very reluctant to my, uh, philosophy on

174
00:07:16.605 --> 00:07:18.025
how we can be better filmmakers

175
00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:21.945
and how we can communicate how to our audience

176
00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:25.065
that we can trust them to know

177
00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:28.385
that we are gonna give them a good time rather than assuming

178
00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:30.825
that they're looking for the first reason to stop watching.

179
00:07:31.405 --> 00:07:33.785
And that becomes a massive communication key.

180
00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:37.065
So Iana, I want to ask you,

181
00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:39.385
how do you guys feel as a creator?

182
00:07:39.485 --> 00:07:40.825
And I want you guys to leave in the comments.

183
00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:45.065
What is the signals you are wanting to push out

184
00:07:45.845 --> 00:07:47.265
and tell your audiences?

185
00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:49.225
What type of video is this?

186
00:07:50.395 --> 00:07:54.335
Uh, it can be, for example, uh,

187
00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:56.895
I watch this YouTube channel called, uh,

188
00:07:57.035 --> 00:07:58.455
new Rock Stars quite a lot,

189
00:07:58.515 --> 00:08:01.415
and they can make these 45 minute long edit, uh,

190
00:08:01.745 --> 00:08:05.055
45 minute long breakdowns of Marvel movies and

191
00:08:05.355 --> 00:08:06.615
or like an hour long video.

192
00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:09.175
And, but they're great to listen to,

193
00:08:09.175 --> 00:08:10.615
but visually they don't do that much.

194
00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:13.815
And because of that, what it means is that I call,

195
00:08:13.885 --> 00:08:18.605
they give me what I call, um, dishwasher content when I,

196
00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:22.875
uh, where I would put their video on, leave it on my phone,

197
00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.635
leave it on my laptop, and then

198
00:08:25.155 --> 00:08:27.835
I would then empty the dishwasher or clean the kitchen.

199
00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:30.395
And so even though there's probably higher retention,

200
00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:32.115
I'm actually not really paying attention.

201
00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:34.795
I'm just, I'm hearing and I'm not really listening.

202
00:08:35.735 --> 00:08:37.915
And if that's the content you kind of wanna make, great,

203
00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:42.115
but I can't tell you what, I've watched maybe five,

204
00:08:42.175 --> 00:08:43.515
six videos of new rock stars this week,

205
00:08:43.515 --> 00:08:45.115
but I can't tell you which ones I watched.

206
00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:47.915
They're instantly forgettable, they're background noise.

207
00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.955
And this new generation of creators, I can tell,

208
00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:53.115
I I have a new feeling is not wanting

209
00:08:53.135 --> 00:08:54.555
to create background noise.

210
00:08:54.815 --> 00:08:57.525
Not anymore new.

211
00:08:57.615 --> 00:09:00.525
These, the creators that we are talking about the most are

212
00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:04.485
the creators that I would describe as TV creators.

213
00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:05.405
These are the creators

214
00:09:05.475 --> 00:09:06.965
that actually are challenging Netflix.

215
00:09:07.055 --> 00:09:10.365
These are the creators that actually are challenging, um,

216
00:09:11.705 --> 00:09:14.445
uh, that actually are challenging, uh, what we would want

217
00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:16.525
to watch on HBO Max or anything like that.

218
00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:20.725
And so some of the examples are is going to be,

219
00:09:20.775 --> 00:09:22.725
lemme just quickly see if I can quickly switch,

220
00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:24.045
find out how I can make that switch.

221
00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:25.725
'cause I didn't get that ready in time, not you.

222
00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.285
Uh, main screen video capture device.

223
00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:31.405
I need you to capture macro, a screen capture, capture,

224
00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:35.445
and then capture my, not that window capture.

225
00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:39.605
Where have you gone, where have

226
00:09:39.605 --> 00:09:40.205
you gone, where have you gone?

227
00:09:43.425 --> 00:09:45.085
Oh, that's just one of my thumbnails. Whoops.

228
00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:45.925
Okay,

229
00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:51.525
there we go.

230
00:09:53.345 --> 00:09:54.645
So, and then let me make

231
00:09:54.645 --> 00:09:55.845
that a little bit bigger for you guys.

232
00:09:57.625 --> 00:09:59.885
So I did not get that page set up in time,

233
00:10:19.905 --> 00:10:20.905
Almost Ready.

234
00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.725
So I'm gonna walk you through some of the craters

235
00:10:27.725 --> 00:10:29.845
that I think have actually have been been doing a really,

236
00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:33.405
really good job in changing what I would describe as,

237
00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:35.285
lemme just change my account as well.

238
00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:41.685
So one of the first new creators, oh, actually tell you

239
00:10:41.685 --> 00:10:43.445
what, let me, let me, let me, lemme just get, let me,

240
00:10:43.445 --> 00:10:45.325
let's go high scale up and then down.

241
00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.245
Um, then I think,

242
00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:50.165
and then let me also just bring my camera back up as well.

243
00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:55.505
There we go. Nah,

244
00:10:55.525 --> 00:10:57.385
that's why I'll put it in the wrong screen.

245
00:11:04.265 --> 00:11:05.835
Okay. All right. We're back. We're back.

246
00:11:05.835 --> 00:11:06.915
We're back in business. Go. So,

247
00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:09.355
Hey Hayden, question, sorry, question for you.

248
00:11:09.415 --> 00:11:11.555
Are you able to share this screen?

249
00:11:11.835 --> 00:11:14.595
'cause it is only visible in your small square.

250
00:11:15.795 --> 00:11:18.635
I don't, uh, um, we could try it that way. Sure.

251
00:11:18.855 --> 00:11:21.995
Um, yeah, or if you wanna send me like this link too

252
00:11:22.055 --> 00:11:24.315
and then I can share as well.

253
00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:26.955
Oh, there we go. Okay, great. Perfect. Thank you.

254
00:11:27.415 --> 00:11:29.755
So, and hopefully you guys can probably still see me then

255
00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:31.155
in that case, I'm gonna switch to the main cam then.

256
00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:32.915
Yep. Okay, then.

257
00:11:35.065 --> 00:11:36.755
Yeah, he made me lose my train of thought.

258
00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:39.675
So one of the creators that has become very much aware

259
00:11:39.675 --> 00:11:41.235
of this obviously has been Mr.

260
00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:43.515
Beast. He is becoming hyper aware

261
00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:46.555
that people are watching his content far more on TV now.

262
00:11:46.895 --> 00:11:50.595
Uh, whereas prior he was very much just, uh,

263
00:11:51.705 --> 00:11:53.115
dedicated to making his videos.

264
00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:56.805
So to watch on your phone, knowing that, hold on.

265
00:11:56.805 --> 00:11:58.165
Let's, let's, let's, let's just go back

266
00:11:58.165 --> 00:11:59.365
to even just a couple years ago.

267
00:12:00.105 --> 00:12:01.565
Uh, oh God. Yeah.

268
00:12:01.905 --> 00:12:05.805
So he, about two, two to three years ago,

269
00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.005
he was focused on making videos.

270
00:12:07.015 --> 00:12:09.685
Eight minutes, 12 minutes, 10 minutes, eight minutes.

271
00:12:10.015 --> 00:12:14.605
Eight minutes was the golden, uh, uh, objective for him.

272
00:12:14.605 --> 00:12:16.925
Simply because if you can make a video past eight minutes,

273
00:12:16.925 --> 00:12:18.485
you're able to monetize anything under eight minutes.

274
00:12:18.595 --> 00:12:20.405
It's, it can't be monetized. But that was always his goal.

275
00:12:20.515 --> 00:12:22.885
Make the videos as short as possible.

276
00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:25.445
Cool works for that time. Not anymore.

277
00:12:25.865 --> 00:12:28.125
Now that we have become better filmmakers,

278
00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:29.845
we have become better storytellers.

279
00:12:30.705 --> 00:12:32.245
We are now able to be rivaling

280
00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:35.165
what people would be seeing on Netflix

281
00:12:35.305 --> 00:12:39.245
and on HBO we have now been pivoting towards longer videos

282
00:12:39.705 --> 00:12:42.005
and longer videos that can be watched on television.

283
00:12:42.305 --> 00:12:43.365
So now look at his videos.

284
00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:48.245
22 minutes, 18 minutes, 20 minutes, 35 minutes.

285
00:12:48.755 --> 00:12:50.645
This 1 41 minutes.

286
00:12:51.865 --> 00:12:55.125
And this is gonna be the most interesting thing

287
00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:57.925
because he has now realized one

288
00:12:57.925 --> 00:12:59.325
of the most valuable currencies.

289
00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:01.405
And I'm gonna ask you guys this, uh, Mitch,

290
00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:02.485
I can even see the chat 'cause I wanna

291
00:13:02.485 --> 00:13:03.485
see if you guys can figure this out.

292
00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:08.325
What do you think is the best way you, it's not engagement.

293
00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:10.365
What do you think is the best way you can develop a

294
00:13:10.365 --> 00:13:11.805
relationship with someone?

295
00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:15.205
I wanna ask you guys that question, this is kind

296
00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:17.085
of a authenticity is a good question.

297
00:13:17.345 --> 00:13:19.085
Is a, is a, is a good answer, but it's not it.

298
00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:20.605
I wanna see if any of you guys are gonna figure this out.

299
00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:22.765
Vulnerability that is also a contributing factor.

300
00:13:23.085 --> 00:13:26.405
Absolutely. Uh, that absolutely do take note of that, uh,

301
00:13:26.965 --> 00:13:28.245
honesty, that is also really great.

302
00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:30.205
There we go. We got it from Brandon.

303
00:13:30.695 --> 00:13:34.005
Spend more time with them. That's the currency here.

304
00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:38.645
If, how many of you guys have had a brief encounter

305
00:13:38.645 --> 00:13:40.965
with someone and then you kind of forget what you had

306
00:13:40.965 --> 00:13:43.085
with them, but then maybe you spend a day with them?

307
00:13:43.085 --> 00:13:45.925
Maybe what, do you have a better relationship

308
00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:47.925
with someone if you've go on a road trip with them,

309
00:13:48.105 --> 00:13:50.445
or you spend a day at a theme park with them,

310
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:53.245
or you do something or,

311
00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:55.605
or you have a, you have a dinner with them

312
00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:59.965
and then you have a much more of a longer, uh, just hang out

313
00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:01.485
with them, you go to a bar afterwards

314
00:14:01.485 --> 00:14:02.565
and you hang out with them.

315
00:14:03.915 --> 00:14:05.925
This is how you develop relationships with people.

316
00:14:06.155 --> 00:14:08.845
It's giving them time and it's actually not just time,

317
00:14:08.985 --> 00:14:10.285
but good time.

318
00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:14.365
Uh, and when we give

319
00:14:14.505 --> 00:14:16.365
and when we are able to give someone good time,

320
00:14:16.705 --> 00:14:18.685
we are wanting and desiring it more.

321
00:14:18.685 --> 00:14:20.165
This is probably the best part of my day.

322
00:14:20.345 --> 00:14:24.365
So I want to tune in and I want to dedicate more of my time

323
00:14:24.585 --> 00:14:27.485
and give it to them because they can give me a great time.

324
00:14:28.865 --> 00:14:31.645
Now, that type of quality time

325
00:14:31.825 --> 00:14:32.925
and which is by the way, is a

326
00:14:32.925 --> 00:14:34.285
love language as well, by the way.

327
00:14:34.465 --> 00:14:37.125
Um, quality time has become such a valuable currency

328
00:14:37.875 --> 00:14:40.325
that we now wanna do everything that we can to get more

329
00:14:40.325 --> 00:14:41.885
of it, uh, and,

330
00:14:42.995 --> 00:14:46.695
and then put ourselves in circumstances to enjoy it more.

331
00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:51.485
For me as a filmmaker, I like to go to the cinema a lot,

332
00:14:51.905 --> 00:14:55.205
but I only go to cinema, to movies that I know are going

333
00:14:55.205 --> 00:14:56.445
to guarantee me a great time.

334
00:14:56.465 --> 00:14:58.765
For example, wicked, uh, I saw another film

335
00:14:58.945 --> 00:15:01.325
or recently called a Nora, uh, gladiator two.

336
00:15:01.325 --> 00:15:02.445
Gladiator two kind of sucked.

337
00:15:02.825 --> 00:15:05.485
But I going into there knowing

338
00:15:05.665 --> 00:15:08.045
and dead choosing to dedicate my time.

339
00:15:08.545 --> 00:15:11.485
And that's also the big, far big part. What is the promise?

340
00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:15.885
Cinema promises me a good time, uh, even

341
00:15:15.885 --> 00:15:17.445
with 30 minutes of ads and whatnot.

342
00:15:19.345 --> 00:15:20.925
So for you guys, I want

343
00:15:20.925 --> 00:15:22.845
to be asking you guys what is the promise?

344
00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:27.685
Jimmy Mr. Beast right now has, is promising a good

345
00:15:28.945 --> 00:15:32.245
su a good time with comedy, with spectacle,

346
00:15:32.245 --> 00:15:33.685
with action, with drama.

347
00:15:34.545 --> 00:15:37.205
But you can only promise that with videos are up to 20,

348
00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:38.445
to 30 to 40 minutes.

349
00:15:39.065 --> 00:15:41.205
And then once that promise has been trained in us,

350
00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:45.725
we then choose to dedicate more, uh, proactively

351
00:15:45.905 --> 00:15:49.285
and actively to engage with, um, our pr

352
00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:52.525
with these creators more rather than, let's just say

353
00:15:52.525 --> 00:15:55.565
with new rock stars, uh, we just do those Marvel breakdowns.

354
00:15:55.685 --> 00:15:57.925
I interact with them much more passively.

355
00:15:58.385 --> 00:16:00.885
I'm gonna empty the dishwasher fine,

356
00:16:00.885 --> 00:16:01.885
I'll put on new rock stars.

357
00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:04.485
Wait a minute, I have 30 to 40 minutes free. I know Mr.

358
00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:06.405
BI has posted a 40 minute video

359
00:16:06.495 --> 00:16:08.605
where some really amazing s**t happens.

360
00:16:08.865 --> 00:16:11.045
Oh, I saw apologies. Uh, I'm British,

361
00:16:11.075 --> 00:16:12.085
it's okay for me to swear.

362
00:16:12.425 --> 00:16:15.725
But, um, and then that quality time

363
00:16:16.405 --> 00:16:17.925
I have chosen to give to him.

364
00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:20.685
And so what do I do? I sit down on my sofa

365
00:16:20.685 --> 00:16:23.125
or couch, I turn on my television,

366
00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:26.285
I go onto the YouTube app, and then I watch those videos.

367
00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:30.635
Three years ago I was watching Mr. Beast videos on my phone.

368
00:16:31.455 --> 00:16:34.195
And now Jimmy has been giving me such great time

369
00:16:34.585 --> 00:16:36.555
that I have accidentally been trained

370
00:16:36.655 --> 00:16:38.475
or purposely been trained to now

371
00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:42.235
exclusively watch his videos on the television

372
00:16:42.865 --> 00:16:47.645
because they feel worthy of being on television.

373
00:16:49.395 --> 00:16:52.535
That's the big thing I want to ask for you guys.

374
00:16:53.395 --> 00:16:56.815
Are you making content that is worthy

375
00:16:57.035 --> 00:16:59.375
of being on television?

376
00:17:01.075 --> 00:17:04.935
If audiences, especially Gen Z, are now choosing to

377
00:17:05.895 --> 00:17:07.015
dedicate more of their time

378
00:17:07.115 --> 00:17:11.215
to watching something on television, is your videos

379
00:17:12.075 --> 00:17:13.655
the thing that they want to watch?

380
00:17:14.155 --> 00:17:15.735
No. Yes, they might be second screening.

381
00:17:15.845 --> 00:17:17.375
They might be putting on one of your videos

382
00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:19.175
and then scrolling on TikTok at the same time.

383
00:17:20.435 --> 00:17:21.735
That's fine. Uh,

384
00:17:21.845 --> 00:17:23.455
that means you can still make passive content,

385
00:17:24.155 --> 00:17:26.295
but if you want intend to make passive content, they don't,

386
00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:27.375
they're not gonna care about you.

387
00:17:27.515 --> 00:17:29.975
And your longevity is just simply not gonna last.

388
00:17:31.575 --> 00:17:34.185
That is why making memorable content

389
00:17:34.735 --> 00:17:36.745
that actually politely asks

390
00:17:36.745 --> 00:17:39.705
for their full attention is the most valuable thing you've

391
00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:43.045
been doing as a creator today, especially

392
00:17:43.185 --> 00:17:44.205
by giving you longevity.

393
00:17:44.465 --> 00:17:46.365
We have seen it with Mr. Beast with this pivot.

394
00:17:47.415 --> 00:17:48.795
Let me give you another creator

395
00:17:49.065 --> 00:17:50.645
who has been following into this pivot

396
00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:53.085
and I think who has been the best,

397
00:17:53.385 --> 00:17:55.365
who is genuinely the best creator today?

398
00:17:55.925 --> 00:17:59.285
Michelle Carre a please tell me you guys are familiar

399
00:17:59.285 --> 00:18:01.885
with Michelle Carre's videos because, uh, other o

400
00:18:02.075 --> 00:18:04.045
otherwise you guys, 'cause you guys are missing out on

401
00:18:04.045 --> 00:18:05.605
what is something absolutely phenomenal.

402
00:18:07.425 --> 00:18:09.205
Oh, something went wrong. Did my internet just go,

403
00:18:11.665 --> 00:18:12.665
Did YouTube crash?

404
00:18:12.785 --> 00:18:13.785
Oh my god,

405
00:18:15.405 --> 00:18:17.085
I know they had some issues yesterday,

406
00:18:17.225 --> 00:18:18.925
so I hope they fixed up.

407
00:18:19.025 --> 00:18:22.285
Oh, mine as well. Let's see.

408
00:18:22.285 --> 00:18:23.245
You know, this is some tea.

409
00:18:27.755 --> 00:18:30.305
There we go. Wait, okay, lemme go onto a channel now.

410
00:18:30.335 --> 00:18:31.985
Okay, tell you what, then I'm gonna move

411
00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:33.025
on to my next point then.

412
00:18:33.845 --> 00:18:35.345
Uh, I want

413
00:18:35.345 --> 00:18:39.185
to, okay,

414
00:18:39.565 --> 00:18:40.905
If you like, I can share my screen

415
00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:42.305
because it's popping up for me.

416
00:18:43.335 --> 00:18:44.465
Okay, yeah, share your screen

417
00:18:44.585 --> 00:18:46.705
and I'm gonna just talk through some of the things

418
00:18:46.705 --> 00:18:47.745
that she's doing at the moment.

419
00:18:48.495 --> 00:18:52.145
Okay. Uh,

420
00:18:52.265 --> 00:18:53.545
I, I, I assume it's up there.

421
00:18:53.545 --> 00:18:54.465
I have so many tabs open,

422
00:18:54.545 --> 00:18:55.745
I actually can't see anything anymore.

423
00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.945
But, so Michelle Carre, she

424
00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:02.745
and her team following the same philosophy when they know

425
00:19:02.745 --> 00:19:04.825
that they can make great content

426
00:19:05.965 --> 00:19:08.865
for YouTube in their own control, they, Michelle,

427
00:19:08.865 --> 00:19:10.225
and not many goes after, as you've known this,

428
00:19:10.225 --> 00:19:15.145
but Michelle Carre was a HBO, uh, presenter.

429
00:19:15.295 --> 00:19:18.465
They ha she does have a HBO show reality TV show

430
00:19:18.465 --> 00:19:22.505
where she was the host and, uh, but they hated it

431
00:19:22.505 --> 00:19:24.425
because they just didn't have control over it.

432
00:19:24.445 --> 00:19:26.745
And they had the studio telling them how to do their job,

433
00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:28.625
whereas they went, well, screw that.

434
00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:30.705
We're gonna do it ourselves. And so now they are making

435
00:19:31.675 --> 00:19:33.225
television quality content

436
00:19:33.485 --> 00:19:35.945
and then putting it onto, uh, YouTube instead.

437
00:19:35.945 --> 00:19:37.065
And now they own full control.

438
00:19:38.165 --> 00:19:41.065
Now, the main reason why I wanted to talk about Michelle is

439
00:19:41.065 --> 00:19:43.785
because they also have a very good understanding of

440
00:19:43.855 --> 00:19:45.705
what I would describe as staying power.

441
00:19:46.805 --> 00:19:49.825
How long does a video stay with you afterwards?

442
00:19:51.325 --> 00:19:54.385
And there was a name

443
00:19:54.445 --> 00:19:56.905
and they spent a good couple months making an hour

444
00:19:57.045 --> 00:19:59.985
and 20 minute long piece of content, which is like, I train,

445
00:20:00.185 --> 00:20:03.305
I trained, I trained like a black belt for 90 days,

446
00:20:03.365 --> 00:20:04.825
and that was an hour and 20 minutes.

447
00:20:04.845 --> 00:20:08.305
And even screened it at a cinema where it was an event where

448
00:20:09.135 --> 00:20:11.185
they screened it at, they screened it at a cinema

449
00:20:11.915 --> 00:20:13.265
where it was a full event.

450
00:20:13.765 --> 00:20:16.105
And, uh, people turned up

451
00:20:16.105 --> 00:20:18.385
and I think some people even paid to be there

452
00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.465
and then screened it because it

453
00:20:19.465 --> 00:20:20.585
was worthy of being in a cinema.

454
00:20:21.485 --> 00:20:23.905
And then as soon as I'd watched it,

455
00:20:24.895 --> 00:20:28.625
that the entire emotional experience that that gave me

456
00:20:29.715 --> 00:20:32.345
meant that it stayed with me for about, I would say two

457
00:20:32.345 --> 00:20:35.845
and a half weeks, uh, that the whole experience

458
00:20:36.465 --> 00:20:37.805
was still at the back of my mind.

459
00:20:37.825 --> 00:20:39.805
And the emotional experiences were still kind

460
00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:42.965
of in my energy day to day for about two and a half weeks.

461
00:20:43.115 --> 00:20:46.885
Whereas again, let's go back to new rock stars where, uh,

462
00:20:46.925 --> 00:20:48.525
which is just another Marvel breakdown.

463
00:20:48.885 --> 00:20:50.645
I cannot tell you, I think I, I I,

464
00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:52.565
I actually watched one of their videos this morning.

465
00:20:52.645 --> 00:20:53.805
I, I've completely forgotten about it.

466
00:20:53.925 --> 00:20:55.645
I, I don't even know, it was just background noise.

467
00:20:56.225 --> 00:20:58.365
So again, I want to keep on asking you what type

468
00:20:58.365 --> 00:20:59.605
of content you're wanting to create,

469
00:21:00.095 --> 00:21:02.185
because the staying power is the most important part.

470
00:21:02.245 --> 00:21:05.185
Now, I actually do wanna show you a couple things with the,

471
00:21:05.385 --> 00:21:09.705
uh, Michelle Carre, uh, boxer video, um, black belt video.

472
00:21:09.875 --> 00:21:10.945
Lemme just load this up

473
00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:12.945
and then I'm going to share a new screen

474
00:21:13.685 --> 00:21:15.625
so I think we can pop everything down.

475
00:21:15.645 --> 00:21:17.025
And then I'm gonna share a new screen

476
00:21:17.025 --> 00:21:19.785
and hopefully that one goes back up top, um,

477
00:21:20.305 --> 00:21:21.585
OBS Adobe Premier Pro.

478
00:21:21.585 --> 00:21:23.585
Okay, but problem is that it's gonna be a little bit choppy

479
00:21:23.585 --> 00:21:24.625
though, which is a shame.

480
00:21:25.685 --> 00:21:27.425
But, uh, alright, so hold on.

481
00:21:27.425 --> 00:21:32.185
This is, so one of the things

482
00:21:32.185 --> 00:21:34.305
that I actually do wanna talk about as an editor

483
00:21:35.725 --> 00:21:37.225
is pacing and flow.

484
00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:39.865
One of the big misconceptions

485
00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:42.345
that I have experienced a lot is

486
00:21:43.055 --> 00:21:44.825
make sure each scene is a minute long.

487
00:21:45.265 --> 00:21:47.065
Anything more than that, people are gonna stop watching,

488
00:21:47.435 --> 00:21:48.745
which is simply not the case.

489
00:21:48.845 --> 00:21:50.745
It has been a very, very frustrating thing.

490
00:21:52.475 --> 00:21:56.055
What the biggest takeaways

491
00:21:56.055 --> 00:21:58.695
that I've got while studying traditional media is they are

492
00:21:58.765 --> 00:22:01.655
very hyper aware of what they would describe as the peaks

493
00:22:01.655 --> 00:22:03.735
and valleys of flow, where

494
00:22:04.035 --> 00:22:05.255
we can reach something to the top.

495
00:22:05.315 --> 00:22:07.295
But if we go to the top, that means we have to go down.

496
00:22:07.315 --> 00:22:09.895
And when we go back down and we have, when we go back down,

497
00:22:09.965 --> 00:22:12.895
that means we have to go back up and we have to be going up

498
00:22:12.895 --> 00:22:13.935
and down these hills

499
00:22:14.395 --> 00:22:16.095
and then climbing higher and higher and higher.

500
00:22:16.715 --> 00:22:18.975
Uh, I think we, we, we, we, me

501
00:22:18.975 --> 00:22:22.415
and Logan followed that same philosophy when we had,

502
00:22:22.415 --> 00:22:23.655
he starts a video of a goal.

503
00:22:23.735 --> 00:22:25.255
I want to get this, he climbs up

504
00:22:25.255 --> 00:22:26.535
to get, to try to reach that goal.

505
00:22:26.535 --> 00:22:28.695
Is he about to reach that goal? And he fools just before it.

506
00:22:29.155 --> 00:22:32.615
And now we then go for this whole, whole new journey into,

507
00:22:32.615 --> 00:22:34.335
towards him actually reaching that goal.

508
00:22:35.495 --> 00:22:39.345
Similar thing for Michelle, when the peaks

509
00:22:39.345 --> 00:22:42.545
and valleys is not a consistent one minute change,

510
00:22:42.545 --> 00:22:45.305
one minute change, one minute change some of these valleys,

511
00:22:45.655 --> 00:22:48.465
some of these valleys could be five to 10 minutes.

512
00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:51.985
And then, and then some of the peaks can be one minute,

513
00:22:52.645 --> 00:22:55.105
but then, but then because she, 'cause of her ego

514
00:22:55.105 --> 00:22:56.665
and her arrogance, she fails again and

515
00:22:56.665 --> 00:22:58.545
therefore she falls back down to a new valley.

516
00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:00.865
And then maybe she has to spend some time in that valley.

517
00:23:00.885 --> 00:23:03.105
But because she's already experienced time in that valley,

518
00:23:03.235 --> 00:23:04.905
she's able to come out of it very quickly

519
00:23:04.965 --> 00:23:06.025
and reach a new peak.

520
00:23:07.365 --> 00:23:10.665
And that what I means is that pacing is flexible.

521
00:23:10.845 --> 00:23:13.705
And the reason why I want to show you this is that each

522
00:23:13.705 --> 00:23:17.585
of these, in this Michelle Carre video,

523
00:23:19.205 --> 00:23:21.185
we are seeing essentially the peaks and valleys.

524
00:23:21.605 --> 00:23:24.665
And what I mean by that is each of these

525
00:23:25.245 --> 00:23:27.825
cut different colors is a length of a scene.

526
00:23:28.805 --> 00:23:33.805
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

527
00:23:41.205 --> 00:23:42.665
So for an hour

528
00:23:42.685 --> 00:23:46.285
and 20 minutes, we actually only had 30 different scenes,

529
00:23:46.865 --> 00:23:47.885
but it was because we were able

530
00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:49.285
to see the peaks and valleys and journey.

531
00:23:49.665 --> 00:23:50.805
And so every time each

532
00:23:50.805 --> 00:23:54.645
of these changes is simply either was a location change, um,

533
00:23:54.665 --> 00:23:58.725
either was a location change or a,

534
00:23:58.785 --> 00:23:59.885
or an emotional change.

535
00:23:59.885 --> 00:24:02.205
Like she learned something new which motivated the next

536
00:24:02.805 --> 00:24:03.845
sequence or scene.

537
00:24:04.475 --> 00:24:05.645
This was just the intro that was

538
00:24:05.645 --> 00:24:06.765
two minute, it was a two minute intro.

539
00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:10.965
That was her entering into the space, uh,

540
00:24:11.405 --> 00:24:12.805
entering, entering into this new world.

541
00:24:12.865 --> 00:24:14.725
And then they start introducing the new world

542
00:24:14.905 --> 00:24:16.205
by, Hey, here's what we do.

543
00:24:16.205 --> 00:24:17.365
That's how amazing this is.

544
00:24:17.705 --> 00:24:18.925
She starts training in the new,

545
00:24:18.945 --> 00:24:20.285
she starts learning the new world

546
00:24:20.465 --> 00:24:23.205
and she turns out she's really bad at it.

547
00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:27.205
Uh, but like she's tried to be cool and then fails,

548
00:24:27.395 --> 00:24:29.685
therefore we have a scene where it's funny,

549
00:24:30.305 --> 00:24:32.645
here's her being funny because she's bad at it.

550
00:24:32.665 --> 00:24:34.605
So we've really straight away, we've shown her

551
00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:36.005
where she needs to go at the top,

552
00:24:36.305 --> 00:24:38.445
and then we throw her straight down to the bottom.

553
00:24:38.585 --> 00:24:41.885
And this is how far she, we've seen where she can go.

554
00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:44.005
And now we need to know where she starts.

555
00:24:44.785 --> 00:24:48.325
And now this entire journey has been that experience.

556
00:24:48.905 --> 00:24:51.765
And each of these is just simply her learning something new

557
00:24:51.875 --> 00:24:54.725
that is informing a new change or a new part of her journey.

558
00:24:55.545 --> 00:24:58.645
Now, one of the most interesting parts about this is

559
00:24:58.925 --> 00:25:01.525
that they actually, if you are wanting to create pieces

560
00:25:01.545 --> 00:25:05.445
of content that has this long, one of the best things

561
00:25:05.445 --> 00:25:09.245
that they did do was, uh, which is kind of called,

562
00:25:09.245 --> 00:25:12.525
which is called this concept, story concept called, uh, kind

563
00:25:12.525 --> 00:25:13.765
of a spine, a story spine.

564
00:25:14.585 --> 00:25:19.285
So very early on they introduced the concept of, um,

565
00:25:19.895 --> 00:25:21.205
lemme see if I can find it.

566
00:25:23.225 --> 00:25:25.405
So they're introducing all of the rules here of what to do

567
00:25:25.795 --> 00:25:26.795
Line. So it becomes

568
00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:28.885
ugly, but I'm gonna be teaching you,

569
00:25:29.025 --> 00:25:30.025
Oh, make sure you guys can hear that.

570
00:25:30.045 --> 00:25:31.205
I guess you guys can hear that. I,

571
00:25:31.205 --> 00:25:33.005
the video might be a bit choppy though. Hold on. There's

572
00:25:33.005 --> 00:25:35.005
Some part form of self-defense.

573
00:25:37.325 --> 00:25:39.445
I wanna know what's inside your heart

574
00:25:39.735 --> 00:25:41.165
after all this training.

575
00:25:41.515 --> 00:25:44.645
What have you learned inside? Not outside

576
00:25:48.825 --> 00:25:49.825
For that, right? There

577
00:25:49.825 --> 00:25:51.485
is one of the most important parts

578
00:25:51.505 --> 00:25:55.285
of the entire video was this guy breaking the brick.

579
00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:57.685
And that's why they made that the climax of that sequence.

580
00:25:57.835 --> 00:26:01.125
This is what the trainer wants her to be able to do.

581
00:26:01.745 --> 00:26:03.805
So that's where the seed was planted.

582
00:26:04.345 --> 00:26:05.525
Uh, and and this was only,

583
00:26:05.525 --> 00:26:07.325
and that seed was only planted about four minutes in,

584
00:26:07.325 --> 00:26:08.605
unless they also talk about it in the intro.

585
00:26:08.605 --> 00:26:12.965
Lemme check. I think they actually do.

586
00:26:16.515 --> 00:26:17.565
Hold on. Yeah, I think they do.

587
00:26:17.835 --> 00:26:21.285
What? How bad do you want it?

588
00:26:21.285 --> 00:26:23.605
What are you willing to do? It's not a given, right?

589
00:26:24.035 --> 00:26:28.445
It's an earned, right? They show your black belt testing

590
00:26:28.625 --> 00:26:30.165
begins now sharp.

591
00:26:37.665 --> 00:26:37.885
So,

592
00:26:43.705 --> 00:26:46.565
So they've even cut here right before the brick.

593
00:26:46.825 --> 00:26:48.045
Uh, her attempting the brick.

594
00:26:48.165 --> 00:26:50.005
I want, did they even, do I even, did they even mention the

595
00:26:50.005 --> 00:26:51.525
brick at during this part?

596
00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:57.245
Uh, brick hold. Lemme check.

597
00:26:58.065 --> 00:27:02.565
And, Okay,

598
00:27:02.565 --> 00:27:03.725
and then is it gonna play

599
00:27:04.165 --> 00:27:06.085
A brick with my bare hand?

600
00:27:06.995 --> 00:27:09.805
Okay, so here's gonna be the next part then.

601
00:27:09.905 --> 00:27:11.845
So the rule has been set.

602
00:27:12.075 --> 00:27:14.685
They withheld information of her breaking a brick,

603
00:27:14.685 --> 00:27:17.085
which is very big iconography on, um,

604
00:27:18.665 --> 00:27:20.445
on uh, karate.

605
00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:22.765
And so for us to then not know if she's willing,

606
00:27:22.785 --> 00:27:24.605
if she's gonna break that brick already gives us

607
00:27:24.605 --> 00:27:26.205
that amount, that amount of tension.

608
00:27:26.305 --> 00:27:29.155
If she's capable of doing this,

609
00:27:29.705 --> 00:27:31.715
they then spent a few minutes later

610
00:27:32.315 --> 00:27:33.555
emphasizing how fricking cool it is.

611
00:27:33.555 --> 00:27:34.955
Here's an expert breaking that brick.

612
00:27:38.665 --> 00:27:40.395
It's, that is the visual representation

613
00:27:40.455 --> 00:27:41.755
and the pinnacle of strength.

614
00:27:41.985 --> 00:27:44.235
That is the ability that she needs to be able to pull off.

615
00:27:44.575 --> 00:27:46.835
So now, now that we've established that,

616
00:27:46.945 --> 00:27:48.995
that means they're now gonna spend the rest of that video

617
00:27:49.585 --> 00:27:52.795
just sprinkling in those moments of her training

618
00:27:52.855 --> 00:27:54.155
and how to break a brick.

619
00:27:54.535 --> 00:27:55.715
Um, here's one of the best parts.

620
00:27:55.775 --> 00:27:56.995
And so I'm gonna just,

621
00:27:56.995 --> 00:27:59.195
I've just searched the word brick on trans on the

622
00:27:59.195 --> 00:28:01.275
transcribing tool and I'm,

623
00:28:01.285 --> 00:28:03.235
we're just gonna play each time the word we're gonna play

624
00:28:03.235 --> 00:28:04.635
each time the word brick is mentioned

625
00:28:04.775 --> 00:28:06.715
and you're gonna see how much it's

626
00:28:06.715 --> 00:28:08.075
sprinkled throughout the entire video.

627
00:28:08.075 --> 00:28:09.075
In fact, I'm gonna zoom out

628
00:28:09.075 --> 00:28:11.195
and so we're gonna see how much it just gets.

629
00:28:11.785 --> 00:28:14.315
It's throughout the video is that main challenge

630
00:28:14.975 --> 00:28:16.515
is always being presented brick

631
00:28:16.785 --> 00:28:18.075
With my bare hand.

632
00:28:19.225 --> 00:28:20.275
Okay, so just shoot it again.

633
00:28:20.275 --> 00:28:21.795
When's the next I'm gonna mention a brick. Brick.

634
00:28:23.405 --> 00:28:24.435
There you go. These

635
00:28:24.435 --> 00:28:26.235
Are your standard three inch red bricks

636
00:28:26.235 --> 00:28:28.155
that you'd find at your local hardware store.

637
00:28:28.265 --> 00:28:31.115
Yeah, if I make even the slightest mistake, the strike can

638
00:28:31.795 --> 00:28:33.875
actually result in me breaking my hand.

639
00:28:34.455 --> 00:28:35.595
So to avoid injury.

640
00:28:35.655 --> 00:28:37.835
So there's a tension. Is she capable of doing this?

641
00:28:37.835 --> 00:28:39.635
Let's find the next time it mentions brick. There we go.

642
00:28:39.785 --> 00:28:40.835
Like just a bare

643
00:28:40.935 --> 00:28:42.355
Bricks that you'd find at your local.

644
00:28:42.665 --> 00:28:44.555
Okay, brick is the last thing

645
00:28:45.005 --> 00:28:47.395
after performing everything else that you have

646
00:28:47.395 --> 00:28:49.995
to do in order to complete the black belt test.

647
00:28:50.625 --> 00:28:52.035
Okay, next time, I'm gonna say brick, brick

648
00:28:52.305 --> 00:28:54.555
With this, this hand

649
00:28:54.765 --> 00:28:56.755
Again, it's, there is a constant presence.

650
00:28:57.065 --> 00:28:58.595
Next scene. BrickX, BrickX,

651
00:29:00.385 --> 00:29:01.385
Then flash.

652
00:29:01.895 --> 00:29:03.715
By a year and a half ago I tested

653
00:29:03.855 --> 00:29:05.315
for my fourth degree black belt

654
00:29:05.455 --> 00:29:07.315
and I had to break four bricks.

655
00:29:08.735 --> 00:29:10.555
It takes a strong will

656
00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:14.195
and strong mind to be able to go through the brick.

657
00:29:14.945 --> 00:29:17.195
Just brick, brick and never time to mention brick. Bricks.

658
00:29:19.035 --> 00:29:21.295
Uh, next time I mention brick, brick, there you go.

659
00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:24.815
And there go. And as her failing to break the

660
00:29:24.815 --> 00:29:28.215
Brick, you're kind of going instead of all together.

661
00:29:28.315 --> 00:29:29.855
And so, and by the way, in all of this,

662
00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:32.815
we are seeing ev all of the other scenes, uh,

663
00:29:32.945 --> 00:29:35.975
focus on her training all of the other aspects of karate.

664
00:29:36.435 --> 00:29:38.215
And it's her winning all of the belts.

665
00:29:38.215 --> 00:29:39.655
And so she's winning and she's winning

666
00:29:39.655 --> 00:29:40.975
and she's getting each new belt

667
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.610
and she's making her way up to black belt.

668
00:29:42.865 --> 00:29:44.525
But every time she's given a win,

669
00:29:45.225 --> 00:29:47.645
we are then given a scene when she's struggling

670
00:29:47.645 --> 00:29:48.765
to break the brick.

671
00:29:49.185 --> 00:29:51.805
And so there is a constant sense of doubt,

672
00:29:52.255 --> 00:29:53.685
which is the most important thing.

673
00:29:54.185 --> 00:29:56.085
If someone is winning and winning and winning and winning

674
00:29:56.085 --> 00:29:57.605
and winning and there is so boring,

675
00:29:58.145 --> 00:29:59.685
we do need that conflict.

676
00:29:59.985 --> 00:30:02.485
And so we do need a constant amount of sense

677
00:30:02.485 --> 00:30:04.525
of is she gonna be capable of pulling this off

678
00:30:05.335 --> 00:30:06.335
Brick? There we go.

679
00:30:06.335 --> 00:30:07.085
Never mention a brick.

680
00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:08.485
I'm gonna search brick again. Bricks,

681
00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:09.545
You can do it too.

682
00:30:10.705 --> 00:30:11.645
But here's actually

683
00:30:11.845 --> 00:30:12.805
probably one of the most important parts.

684
00:30:13.025 --> 00:30:14.285
It became so effective.

685
00:30:14.755 --> 00:30:16.965
They actually didn't really need to mention brick anymore.

686
00:30:17.305 --> 00:30:22.085
And then right before what was going to be her main car,

687
00:30:22.545 --> 00:30:24.965
excuse me, her winning the black belt,

688
00:30:24.985 --> 00:30:26.245
the pinnacle, the climax.

689
00:30:26.875 --> 00:30:29.285
They then played this scene right before

690
00:30:30.385 --> 00:30:32.045
We are actually here.

691
00:30:32.355 --> 00:30:34.685
There's one more hurdle that you have to go over.

692
00:30:35.785 --> 00:30:38.965
You have been a very special person to me

693
00:30:39.035 --> 00:30:41.045
because you're so dedicated.

694
00:30:41.435 --> 00:30:44.165
I've taught TaeKwonDo for over 45, 50

695
00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:45.525
years now. And you are,

696
00:30:45.665 --> 00:30:49.485
And by the way, uh, the trainer is, is optimistic.

697
00:30:49.785 --> 00:30:52.645
You are an amazing trainer. You have incredible power.

698
00:30:52.755 --> 00:30:54.245
I've never seen this. I've never seen someone

699
00:30:54.245 --> 00:30:55.685
this amount of dedication.

700
00:30:56.925 --> 00:30:58.935
It's, it's, the music is triumphant.

701
00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:01.095
It's really given this amazing sense of optimism.

702
00:31:01.145 --> 00:31:03.575
She's gonna get a black belt. This is gonna be easy.

703
00:31:04.085 --> 00:31:05.815
Hell yeah. What's the point of this video?

704
00:31:05.925 --> 00:31:07.695
Like, I'm bored now or like

705
00:31:07.795 --> 00:31:09.615
One of the most dedicated students

706
00:31:09.615 --> 00:31:11.055
that I've ever met Permission

707
00:31:11.055 --> 00:31:12.055
To break. Sir, do it.

708
00:31:12.055 --> 00:31:14.895
Permission to break, sir. Do it.

709
00:31:17.145 --> 00:31:20.615
Thank you. I just hope that you prepare your mind

710
00:31:20.715 --> 00:31:22.015
and body permission to break.

711
00:31:22.015 --> 00:31:24.135
Sir, Do it. You have a big battle in front of you.

712
00:31:24.425 --> 00:31:26.855
Don't get negative, don't get scared

713
00:31:27.365 --> 00:31:32.295
because if you do, you already lost the battle. Permission

714
00:31:32.295 --> 00:31:33.295
To break, Sir.

715
00:31:33.305 --> 00:31:34.305
Let's do it.

716
00:31:42.075 --> 00:31:44.495
Ooh, Powerful stuff. Very, very powerful.

717
00:31:44.835 --> 00:31:47.135
And then also most importantly, did you guys pick up,

718
00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:51.415
there's like music, music, music, build, build, build.

719
00:31:51.635 --> 00:31:53.695
Really, really great structuring here.

720
00:31:54.355 --> 00:31:56.055
And then we had I think one

721
00:31:56.055 --> 00:31:58.615
of the most important parts of all storytelling.

722
00:31:59.355 --> 00:32:04.055
The real moment when we just take our editing away.

723
00:32:04.755 --> 00:32:07.895
Uh, you should, when the editor has to stop

724
00:32:07.895 --> 00:32:10.375
and just let the moment breathe for itself

725
00:32:10.475 --> 00:32:11.535
and where you don't have to do anything.

726
00:32:11.535 --> 00:32:13.295
And that's exactly what happened here. Let's

727
00:32:13.295 --> 00:32:14.295
Do it.

728
00:32:21.935 --> 00:32:25.425
Because sometimes the most important job an editor

729
00:32:25.425 --> 00:32:26.505
and a storyteller can do is

730
00:32:26.505 --> 00:32:28.465
to actually let the story tell itself.

731
00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:31.505
Uh, the editor didn't need to do anything there.

732
00:32:32.125 --> 00:32:37.025
Her emotion of uh, struggling to break that brick,

733
00:32:38.205 --> 00:32:41.005
the, and her sort of exasperation

734
00:32:41.005 --> 00:32:45.085
and her, um, exhales very much implied her fear.

735
00:32:46.005 --> 00:32:48.485
I the editor did not need to do anything there.

736
00:32:49.345 --> 00:32:51.845
And for us, it then also cut away.

737
00:32:51.905 --> 00:32:53.845
So soon was also quite frustrating

738
00:32:53.845 --> 00:32:58.585
because we wanted to see how, how is she feeling with this?

739
00:32:58.965 --> 00:33:00.505
But now that the fact that we cut to

740
00:33:00.505 --> 00:33:02.505
what would be just the day she gets a black belt,

741
00:33:02.935 --> 00:33:04.905
it's like we now get the full on implication

742
00:33:04.905 --> 00:33:06.065
that she's not prepared.

743
00:33:07.615 --> 00:33:09.195
Now throughout the rest of this though,

744
00:33:09.415 --> 00:33:11.275
we now get her just absolutely

745
00:33:11.275 --> 00:33:13.075
because it's Michelle Carra, she's kicking ass.

746
00:33:15.655 --> 00:33:17.115
So here's her breaking some wood.

747
00:33:17.215 --> 00:33:18.835
Oh no, actually even even this.

748
00:33:28.935 --> 00:33:30.435
And you said that little reaction there,

749
00:33:30.465 --> 00:33:31.595
that was super important.

750
00:33:31.655 --> 00:33:33.235
Uh, looking for those micro movements,

751
00:33:33.235 --> 00:33:34.755
that was such an important micro movement

752
00:33:34.755 --> 00:33:35.875
There she tries again.

753
00:33:37.505 --> 00:33:40.355
Yeah, Still fails, tries again.

754
00:33:43.055 --> 00:33:44.395
She finally breaks it. Brilliant.

755
00:33:44.895 --> 00:33:46.715
And then she just starts kicking ass. Amazing.

756
00:33:50.735 --> 00:33:52.475
So now we think maybe she could do this.

757
00:33:52.475 --> 00:33:53.675
Like maybe she can't artist.

758
00:33:53.775 --> 00:33:55.835
Anyway, she still does some cool badass stuff.

759
00:33:56.295 --> 00:33:56.515
Ah,

760
00:34:03.465 --> 00:34:04.465
Yeah, she's amazing. She

761
00:34:04.465 --> 00:34:06.675
does a, she she does a really cool motivator speech,

762
00:34:06.675 --> 00:34:07.675
motivational speech.

763
00:34:08.095 --> 00:34:09.115
She kicks some ass.

764
00:34:10.795 --> 00:34:12.275
I take on a Challenge and all of this,

765
00:34:12.275 --> 00:34:13.675
this is one big scene.

766
00:34:13.675 --> 00:34:15.115
This is the climax of it all.

767
00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:18.395
But now we'd now come

768
00:34:18.395 --> 00:34:20.755
because we've been brick, brick, brick, brick,

769
00:34:20.755 --> 00:34:22.915
brick front this entire and we are an hour

770
00:34:22.975 --> 00:34:24.635
and six minutes into this pile away.

771
00:34:24.895 --> 00:34:28.075
Go. And she's still being amazing at this.

772
00:34:28.415 --> 00:34:31.475
But, and this is it. This is the final moment of the break.

773
00:34:31.785 --> 00:34:33.795
Tension, tension, tension. We're link this race.

774
00:34:33.855 --> 00:34:35.435
But now we've been given mo the most

775
00:34:35.435 --> 00:34:36.635
important part, which is context.

776
00:34:38.015 --> 00:34:39.915
You just gotta Break

777
00:34:40.045 --> 00:34:41.275
Permission to break sir.

778
00:34:41.365 --> 00:34:42.515
Permission. I Know

779
00:34:45.535 --> 00:34:46.755
You gotta really go for it.

780
00:34:47.815 --> 00:34:49.315
Oh yeah. Even look at this, uh,

781
00:34:49.345 --> 00:34:51.355
even the editing has pulled back and stopped again.

782
00:34:51.425 --> 00:34:52.425
Yeah,

783
00:34:57.035 --> 00:35:00.755
Michelle, this is the last thing that's in your way, okay?

784
00:35:02.055 --> 00:35:05.235
You gotta really go for it this time, okay? Yes sir.

785
00:35:11.515 --> 00:35:14.075
A lot of my students break their hand doing this.

786
00:35:16.025 --> 00:35:19.315
Okay then. And then and, and did you even see that lot?

787
00:35:19.315 --> 00:35:21.395
Like a lot of students break my break their hand doing this

788
00:35:21.395 --> 00:35:22.875
and then the music comes back in.

789
00:35:23.135 --> 00:35:24.315
And that's kind of an interesting moment.

790
00:35:24.495 --> 00:35:27.155
But then, okay, but then this is when we get, when she's,

791
00:35:27.175 --> 00:35:28.235
is she gonna break the brick?

792
00:35:28.535 --> 00:35:30.155
And again, we've been given all

793
00:35:30.155 --> 00:35:31.795
of this context to see if this is gonna work,

794
00:35:46.045 --> 00:35:47.045
Get angry.

795
00:35:48.685 --> 00:35:52.985
So she tries again, doesn't work.

796
00:35:57.205 --> 00:35:57.945
We spent some time

797
00:36:03.035 --> 00:36:03.985
build, build, build.

798
00:36:05.085 --> 00:36:08.325
And then, and, and by the way, in between each

799
00:36:08.325 --> 00:36:12.285
of these punches is about 45 seconds to a minute

800
00:36:12.285 --> 00:36:15.165
and a half of tension building on every single,

801
00:36:15.425 --> 00:36:16.765
on every single hit.

802
00:36:48.585 --> 00:36:53.475
Now this is something that I think is incredibly important

803
00:36:53.495 --> 00:36:54.715
for us as storytellers.

804
00:36:55.975 --> 00:36:58.795
And one of you guys even mentioned it in the chat earlier,

805
00:36:58.795 --> 00:37:00.155
which is the vulnerability part.

806
00:37:00.155 --> 00:37:04.415
And the vulnerability part also means showing failure.

807
00:37:06.715 --> 00:37:10.295
We just spent an hour and 11 minutes watching her achieve

808
00:37:10.435 --> 00:37:13.775
and grow and do incredible things.

809
00:37:14.355 --> 00:37:15.975
And even though the sense is a doubt,

810
00:37:16.915 --> 00:37:18.135
it seems like she's the person

811
00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:19.935
that is fully capable of pulling this off.

812
00:37:20.855 --> 00:37:24.975
But yet we just had something, a very, very unique moment.

813
00:37:26.185 --> 00:37:30.135
She failed. She could not receive the black belt.

814
00:37:30.795 --> 00:37:33.615
Uh, black belt's not wanna have a little meeting.

815
00:37:34.635 --> 00:37:36.175
Jim, Mr. Boroughs.

816
00:37:36.435 --> 00:37:38.455
Yep. And then they spend the rest of the video discussing,

817
00:37:38.475 --> 00:37:39.655
is she worthy of the black belt?

818
00:37:39.655 --> 00:37:42.935
And I gonna give it to her. And they say, no

819
00:37:44.745 --> 00:37:46.175
Thank you sir. Thank no

820
00:37:46.175 --> 00:37:47.175
No again, again. And

821
00:37:47.175 --> 00:37:49.095
couple of weeks when your hands are completely

822
00:37:49.095 --> 00:37:50.215
healed. Okay, Michelle? Yes

823
00:37:50.215 --> 00:37:50.735
Sir. Thank you sir.

824
00:37:51.075 --> 00:37:54.175
She failed At the heart of this journey.

825
00:37:54.885 --> 00:37:56.975
Lies in your inner desire to,

826
00:37:59.355 --> 00:38:01.015
But oh, oh, my voice broke there.

827
00:38:01.255 --> 00:38:02.655
'cause 'cause this stuff gets me emotional,

828
00:38:02.755 --> 00:38:05.935
but here is the thing that I really, really like about this.

829
00:38:06.845 --> 00:38:09.095
Just 'cause you fail doesn't mean it's over.

830
00:38:09.435 --> 00:38:11.855
And so the whole, the rest of the video actually then begins

831
00:38:11.855 --> 00:38:13.175
to wrap up of her.

832
00:38:13.175 --> 00:38:14.175
Just keep on trying.

833
00:38:14.195 --> 00:38:15.695
And then that is actually the big lesson.

834
00:38:15.955 --> 00:38:17.855
And that actually then became the theme of it.

835
00:38:18.315 --> 00:38:19.495
The fact that she's consistent

836
00:38:19.515 --> 00:38:21.655
and doesn't allow failure to define her,

837
00:38:21.875 --> 00:38:23.935
but allows failure to motivate her.

838
00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:25.895
And so now the rest of the video goes into a whole

839
00:38:26.415 --> 00:38:28.815
sequence about her keep putting up to continue trying.

840
00:38:29.125 --> 00:38:32.775
Even though Annie spent 90 days trying to do all of this,

841
00:38:33.385 --> 00:38:35.565
she's now on day 112 was kinda like a

842
00:38:35.565 --> 00:38:36.645
little twist at the end in a way.

843
00:38:38.225 --> 00:38:39.085
So she keeps trying

844
00:39:19.705 --> 00:39:21.605
and she still failed.

845
00:39:28.965 --> 00:39:31.205
I didn't get my black belt on day 90

846
00:39:32.905 --> 00:39:37.645
or on day 112, and I still might not by day 200,

847
00:39:39.185 --> 00:39:41.085
but that's okay

848
00:39:42.235 --> 00:39:46.365
because you can always keep trying.

849
00:39:49.425 --> 00:39:52.305
And that was the theme. I get emotional.

850
00:39:52.485 --> 00:39:54.465
I'm a very emotional person that was bloody beautiful.

851
00:39:55.135 --> 00:39:58.385
That, and so the theme of this entire, uh,

852
00:39:58.515 --> 00:40:02.345
video was just keep trying and to never give up.

853
00:40:02.485 --> 00:40:04.705
And she, and, and there was proof that she never did.

854
00:40:05.975 --> 00:40:10.845
Uh, and just, it was, it's such an beautiful thing.

855
00:40:10.945 --> 00:40:12.285
And, but the most important thing,

856
00:40:12.285 --> 00:40:15.925
and I've even talked about this a lot, it's who she, the,

857
00:40:16.105 --> 00:40:19.125
the most important part of a video being memorable is

858
00:40:19.345 --> 00:40:21.205
who she is here right at the end.

859
00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:26.325
Oh man, f**k, I'm emotional, uh, of who she's here

860
00:40:26.945 --> 00:40:31.085
is vastly different to the person here.

861
00:40:40.105 --> 00:40:43.545
I knew if I wanted any chance at earning a black belt in

862
00:40:43.545 --> 00:40:45.465
TaeKwonDo in 90 days, I,

863
00:40:46.165 --> 00:40:48.025
And now again, I wanna emphasize again

864
00:40:48.025 --> 00:40:50.905
and now look at the person at the end of this video.

865
00:40:52.995 --> 00:40:55.615
Black e her black.

866
00:41:05.085 --> 00:41:07.305
Oh yeah, even that. Okay.

867
00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:09.585
Actually, here's a great little detail even on top

868
00:41:09.585 --> 00:41:12.625
of this in terms of allowing things

869
00:41:12.625 --> 00:41:13.585
that happened at the beginning

870
00:41:13.695 --> 00:41:14.865
also inform something at the end.

871
00:41:14.865 --> 00:41:16.825
Lemme just, lemme just lift this up here.

872
00:41:17.825 --> 00:41:20.915
Uh, just so we get at, sorry,

873
00:41:21.215 --> 00:41:23.155
I'm gonna show you something else I forgot about this part.

874
00:41:24.285 --> 00:41:25.865
Um, as soon as the,

875
00:41:26.165 --> 00:41:28.065
so there is this whole sequence right at the beginning

876
00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:32.025
of this when he is breaking down, uh, what it is

877
00:41:32.025 --> 00:41:33.845
to be a karate black belt. When

878
00:41:33.845 --> 00:41:34.925
You're ready, Sir.

879
00:41:36.185 --> 00:41:37.925
So this is her introduction to the world.

880
00:41:42.225 --> 00:41:46.845
Our human body has lines when the punch is done correctly

881
00:41:46.865 --> 00:41:48.725
and the line is straight, it's pretty.

882
00:41:49.225 --> 00:41:51.525
But soon as the wrist is either like that

883
00:41:51.905 --> 00:41:55.685
or like that, it breaks that beauty line so it becomes ugly.

884
00:41:56.035 --> 00:41:58.605
What I'm gonna be teaching you is an art

885
00:41:58.635 --> 00:41:59.885
form of self-defense.

886
00:42:02.045 --> 00:42:04.205
I wanna know what's inside your heart

887
00:42:04.495 --> 00:42:05.805
after all this training.

888
00:42:06.075 --> 00:42:09.285
What have you learned inside? Not outside.

889
00:42:13.025 --> 00:42:14.125
So we see that sequence.

890
00:42:14.425 --> 00:42:16.485
And now after we've spent an hour

891
00:42:16.585 --> 00:42:19.995
of watching Michelle train, this is what we get

892
00:42:21.725 --> 00:42:23.155
After all this training.

893
00:42:24.105 --> 00:42:27.075
What have you learned inside? Not outside.

894
00:42:55.095 --> 00:42:58.155
So this is the most important part of storytelling.

895
00:42:58.665 --> 00:43:00.555
What you are doing at the beginning needs

896
00:43:00.555 --> 00:43:02.995
to absolutely be informing something at the end.

897
00:43:03.845 --> 00:43:05.715
Everything you are beginning is setting

898
00:43:05.895 --> 00:43:07.115
up for you to be paying off.

899
00:43:07.145 --> 00:43:09.475
Like we, we know that we've talked about this so often,

900
00:43:09.855 --> 00:43:11.435
but these are the ways of storytelling

901
00:43:11.435 --> 00:43:13.515
that you can bring these connections together

902
00:43:13.615 --> 00:43:15.555
and for us to really, really understand it.

903
00:43:15.855 --> 00:43:16.995
And what this means is

904
00:43:16.995 --> 00:43:18.875
that you can start making much longer content

905
00:43:19.025 --> 00:43:21.035
because the context is consistent

906
00:43:21.295 --> 00:43:24.995
and you are consistently providing context that is informing

907
00:43:24.995 --> 00:43:26.475
what is happening towards the end.

908
00:43:27.345 --> 00:43:32.115
This is what is satisfying content.

909
00:43:33.385 --> 00:43:35.605
And, and if you are closing those loops,

910
00:43:35.605 --> 00:43:36.845
opening those loops at the beginning,

911
00:43:37.465 --> 00:43:39.765
and then spending significant time

912
00:43:39.905 --> 00:43:41.365
to develop the relationship

913
00:43:41.705 --> 00:43:44.965
and then be closing those loops at the end, 20 minutes,

914
00:43:44.965 --> 00:43:48.125
30 minutes, 40 minutes later, you are

915
00:43:49.365 --> 00:43:52.045
creating a satisfying video that will stay with me.

916
00:43:52.425 --> 00:43:56.885
So much so that I have completely just improvised

917
00:43:57.105 --> 00:43:58.765
and completely derailed this whole webinar

918
00:43:58.765 --> 00:44:00.645
because I just wanted to nerd out about this video

919
00:44:00.645 --> 00:44:04.645
with you guys because of the passion that I had wanting

920
00:44:04.745 --> 00:44:06.325
to just talk about it with you guys.

921
00:44:07.235 --> 00:44:09.885
Whereas I don't give a crap about

922
00:44:09.885 --> 00:44:11.925
what the video I watched about new rock stars today.

923
00:44:12.345 --> 00:44:13.725
And that is what I'm trying

924
00:44:13.725 --> 00:44:15.525
to say is the new currency of YouTube.

925
00:44:16.565 --> 00:44:18.745
It is the main currency is deeper

926
00:44:18.745 --> 00:44:20.785
relationships and memorability.

927
00:44:21.375 --> 00:44:24.345
It's not, not don't, I don't care about relatability.

928
00:44:24.735 --> 00:44:28.025
It's memorability. Is this going to stay?

929
00:44:28.095 --> 00:44:30.585
What is the staying power of your content?

930
00:44:31.225 --> 00:44:34.205
And if you have that good amount of staying power,

931
00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:37.365
you could, would then make your content worthy

932
00:44:37.465 --> 00:44:40.365
of being on television where viewers will be choosing

933
00:44:40.425 --> 00:44:42.245
to not just watch your stuff passively and,

934
00:44:42.345 --> 00:44:43.565
and do dishwasher content,

935
00:44:43.985 --> 00:44:47.125
but actually intentionally choose to watch your videos.

936
00:44:47.875 --> 00:44:51.125
When Michelle posts. I don't instantly watch it.

937
00:44:51.545 --> 00:44:53.685
Uh, but I will on a Friday

938
00:44:53.825 --> 00:44:56.685
or Saturday morning, dedicate my time to her.

939
00:44:57.275 --> 00:44:58.645
That is the most important time.

940
00:44:59.555 --> 00:45:02.725
Develop a relationship with your audience that then choose

941
00:45:02.945 --> 00:45:05.565
and are excited to dedicate their time to you

942
00:45:05.675 --> 00:45:08.605
because you are giving them the most important currency

943
00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:11.445
of a love language quality time.

944
00:45:13.175 --> 00:45:15.635
Um, with that though, that's kind of one I'm,

945
00:45:15.635 --> 00:45:17.275
that's the kind of the point I wanna wrap this on.

946
00:45:17.735 --> 00:45:19.795
Uh, with that though, is there any other follow ups

947
00:45:19.795 --> 00:45:21.595
or questions or thoughts that we could probably talk about,

948
00:45:21.695 --> 00:45:24.435
uh, with that or, uh, where is the chat?

949
00:45:24.435 --> 00:45:25.995
There we go. We've got that AR

950
00:45:26.015 --> 00:45:27.515
and Samara raising their hand.

951
00:45:28.535 --> 00:45:32.115
Um, why don't we go for it? Cool. Uh, I'll bring them in.

952
00:45:35.475 --> 00:45:38.535
Oh, okay. Hi, how are you doing

953
00:45:38.535 --> 00:45:39.615
Great. How you doing? Good to meet you.

954
00:45:40.195 --> 00:45:42.175
I'm good. Um, I wrote my question

955
00:45:42.515 --> 00:45:43.895
so, 'cause it's a little bit much.

956
00:45:44.715 --> 00:45:47.655
Um, so I said I'm a singer just beginning

957
00:45:47.655 --> 00:45:49.695
to actually break my way into the music industry.

958
00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:54.055
And I have this big vision to document my journey, uh,

959
00:45:54.055 --> 00:45:57.375
through a show that will not only capture it in a MTV kind

960
00:45:57.375 --> 00:46:00.015
of way, but also serve as a platform to tell my story.

961
00:46:00.045 --> 00:46:01.855
Like along with my vision for like

962
00:46:01.855 --> 00:46:03.175
how I want to do social media in general.

963
00:46:03.565 --> 00:46:06.935
Yeah. And so I have ideas for how, how I want the show

964
00:46:06.935 --> 00:46:08.135
to look like and feel like

965
00:46:08.195 --> 00:46:10.855
and even have people ready to help bring it to life.

966
00:46:11.835 --> 00:46:14.655
Um, sorry, I'm like nervous.

967
00:46:15.675 --> 00:46:17.055
Um, the problem is I feel stuck

968
00:46:17.055 --> 00:46:18.175
because I dunno how to structure it

969
00:46:18.195 --> 00:46:20.295
or start the show in a way that doesn't overwhelm me.

970
00:46:20.295 --> 00:46:21.975
And I want to focus on creating music

971
00:46:22.155 --> 00:46:23.575
and being the performer that I am,

972
00:46:23.595 --> 00:46:25.695
but I feel like I'm not documenting it.

973
00:46:26.235 --> 00:46:28.535
Um, and I wanna, I don't wanna miss out on those moments

974
00:46:28.565 --> 00:46:29.975
that can make the show incredible.

975
00:46:30.355 --> 00:46:32.255
Um, so I want to know, like,

976
00:46:32.255 --> 00:46:34.255
how would you recommend creating a show while also

977
00:46:34.255 --> 00:46:36.295
balancing, um, my music career

978
00:46:36.395 --> 00:46:39.525
and not letting like this hold me back?

979
00:46:39.545 --> 00:46:41.325
You know, it's kind of like overwhelming.

980
00:46:41.875 --> 00:46:43.645
Well, yeah, it can be quite an overwhelming thing,

981
00:46:43.645 --> 00:46:45.805
but I think it also looks like surrounding yourself

982
00:46:45.805 --> 00:46:48.445
with a team that could pro, that can be supportive in that

983
00:46:48.465 --> 00:46:51.815
and then probably delegating part of it to be their sort of,

984
00:46:51.815 --> 00:46:53.135
their responsibility to help you.

985
00:46:53.155 --> 00:46:55.855
So you can probably focus more on your journey, such as with

986
00:46:55.965 --> 00:46:58.175
what we just saw with Michelle to an extent,

987
00:46:58.175 --> 00:46:59.415
she wasn't really in charge of the story,

988
00:46:59.415 --> 00:47:01.775
it was the director and it was the editors

989
00:47:01.835 --> 00:47:04.015
and it was the producers who were helping her

990
00:47:04.015 --> 00:47:06.535
and guiding her so she could have the personal journey while

991
00:47:06.535 --> 00:47:08.415
they were then also guiding towards the story.

992
00:47:08.715 --> 00:47:11.015
So her husband Garrett is the director

993
00:47:11.015 --> 00:47:12.255
of the Michelle Carre Show.

994
00:47:12.755 --> 00:47:15.335
And he is always making sure that, um,

995
00:47:16.615 --> 00:47:18.265
that the trainers

996
00:47:18.265 --> 00:47:20.265
and the mentors are giving her a sense of change.

997
00:47:20.965 --> 00:47:22.905
Uh, and Michelle was a storyteller.

998
00:47:22.905 --> 00:47:24.585
She's always looking for what is the new thing

999
00:47:24.585 --> 00:47:26.865
that I can learn and it's giving me something

1000
00:47:26.865 --> 00:47:29.645
that's gonna give me impro, make me be better or get worse.

1001
00:47:29.905 --> 00:47:32.525
And so every single scene has that moment of change.

1002
00:47:32.525 --> 00:47:34.885
And so for you to not be overwhelmed is actually

1003
00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:36.725
to be excited about the fact that you're looking for

1004
00:47:37.115 --> 00:47:39.645
that new little bit of lesson, that new change.

1005
00:47:40.255 --> 00:47:42.525
Allow your curiosity to be the natural

1006
00:47:43.295 --> 00:47:46.085
invitation towards something new happening.

1007
00:47:47.185 --> 00:47:50.605
And, and then that's just simply being documented.

1008
00:47:51.105 --> 00:47:53.565
Um, and then hopefully trusting people

1009
00:47:53.565 --> 00:47:54.925
that'll be able to document it well.

1010
00:47:54.925 --> 00:47:57.005
And so you are able to still have that personal journey

1011
00:47:57.105 --> 00:47:58.965
as long as you are actively looking for that change.

1012
00:47:59.555 --> 00:48:01.245
It's the content will naturally be there.

1013
00:48:01.835 --> 00:48:06.365
Then afterwards, uh, the main thing I would suggest is

1014
00:48:07.065 --> 00:48:08.125
at the end of every day

1015
00:48:08.145 --> 00:48:10.965
or at the end of every of one of those filming sessions, you

1016
00:48:11.145 --> 00:48:12.365
or even the director

1017
00:48:12.425 --> 00:48:15.005
or even the editor, whoever you trust as a storyteller

1018
00:48:15.005 --> 00:48:17.485
of this discuss, have a conversation.

1019
00:48:17.715 --> 00:48:19.005
What are the moments you like the most?

1020
00:48:19.005 --> 00:48:21.125
What were the moments that felt really interesting?

1021
00:48:21.275 --> 00:48:23.725
What are emotional change that you have?

1022
00:48:23.725 --> 00:48:25.485
Maybe even at the end of those filming sessions,

1023
00:48:25.735 --> 00:48:28.725
maybe just have the, whoever's filming, just ask, ask,

1024
00:48:28.755 --> 00:48:30.845
have them ask you a couple questions right there on end.

1025
00:48:30.845 --> 00:48:31.885
And so you can improvise

1026
00:48:31.945 --> 00:48:34.005
and try to share your feelings and your thoughts.

1027
00:48:34.385 --> 00:48:38.255
And essentially you then need to create a diary of

1028
00:48:38.285 --> 00:48:39.495
what is happening every day.

1029
00:48:39.835 --> 00:48:43.735
And Michelle and Garrett had that behind the scenes a diary

1030
00:48:43.735 --> 00:48:45.575
of what happened on every single shoot

1031
00:48:45.575 --> 00:48:46.975
date and what it means.

1032
00:48:46.975 --> 00:48:48.815
It's not in your head, it's written somewhere.

1033
00:48:48.835 --> 00:48:50.295
And then you are able to see it all in

1034
00:48:50.295 --> 00:48:51.375
that sort of macro scale.

1035
00:48:52.035 --> 00:48:53.735
And then find the bits of the story

1036
00:48:53.735 --> 00:48:55.775
that had the best connective tissue, such

1037
00:48:55.795 --> 00:48:57.985
as the brick thing, uh, on net,

1038
00:48:58.105 --> 00:48:59.705
Michelle video, uh, high chance.

1039
00:48:59.705 --> 00:49:02.825
They didn't really discover that being such a huge thing

1040
00:49:03.435 --> 00:49:07.145
until it, until she failed at the brick breaking.

1041
00:49:07.935 --> 00:49:10.115
And therefore, because of that, they then went, oh,

1042
00:49:10.115 --> 00:49:12.395
wait a minute, now that we know this, let's make

1043
00:49:12.395 --> 00:49:14.035
that the big thing in the edit

1044
00:49:14.175 --> 00:49:16.195
of her always constantly trying to break that brick,

1045
00:49:16.625 --> 00:49:19.155
that was no way could they have anticipated that

1046
00:49:19.205 --> 00:49:20.635
until the journey was over.

1047
00:49:20.735 --> 00:49:22.395
And so also when this journey is over,

1048
00:49:23.025 --> 00:49:25.635
what was the biggest change in revelation that you had?

1049
00:49:26.095 --> 00:49:30.075
It was, I realized this thing about me was holding me back

1050
00:49:30.145 --> 00:49:31.955
once I was able to come to terms of this,

1051
00:49:32.615 --> 00:49:34.075
and I then went on stage

1052
00:49:34.135 --> 00:49:36.275
and performed in front of everyone and everyone loved it.

1053
00:49:36.875 --> 00:49:41.025
I overcame that thing now, now that you overcame it,

1054
00:49:41.125 --> 00:49:43.025
now you go back through everything you filmed

1055
00:49:43.045 --> 00:49:46.865
and find connections that were building towards

1056
00:49:47.255 --> 00:49:49.875
that conflict, and then everything else

1057
00:49:49.935 --> 00:49:52.595
that's not related towards that change, you delete.

1058
00:49:53.215 --> 00:49:57.115
So, and if it's not informing you overcoming that trauma

1059
00:49:57.335 --> 00:50:00.035
or overcoming that change or overcoming that fear

1060
00:50:00.135 --> 00:50:02.515
or overcoming that barrier, anything

1061
00:50:02.515 --> 00:50:06.155
that's not related towards that change, f**k it all.

1062
00:50:06.555 --> 00:50:07.555
Just like delete it all.

1063
00:50:08.095 --> 00:50:10.115
I'm British, I can swear it's, and,

1064
00:50:10.175 --> 00:50:11.515
and so, uh, that's,

1065
00:50:11.515 --> 00:50:13.355
that's gonna be my suggestion towards that.

1066
00:50:13.865 --> 00:50:17.115
Just keep a diary, have conversations,

1067
00:50:18.235 --> 00:50:20.795
document your feelings, document all of the feelings,

1068
00:50:21.055 --> 00:50:24.315
and then once you know how this story ends, you know,

1069
00:50:24.315 --> 00:50:25.435
how have all of the options

1070
00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:26.515
and then delete everything else

1071
00:50:26.545 --> 00:50:28.510
that does not inform that change.

1072
00:50:29.415 --> 00:50:31.715
So just like start filming, go at it

1073
00:50:31.775 --> 00:50:33.715
and then kind of come together later

1074
00:50:33.735 --> 00:50:35.115
and figure it out in a way.

1075
00:50:35.115 --> 00:50:40.035
Exactly. Document, document everything and then, and,

1076
00:50:40.175 --> 00:50:43.155
but document everything and, and then find that through line

1077
00:50:43.175 --> 00:50:44.395
and then ignore everything

1078
00:50:44.395 --> 00:50:45.915
that doesn't relate to that free line.

1079
00:50:46.505 --> 00:50:47.995
Okay. Got it. So I have

1080
00:50:47.995 --> 00:50:50.915
to dis like define my free line, I guess first.

1081
00:50:52.375 --> 00:50:54.145
Well you might, you might not find it

1082
00:50:54.155 --> 00:50:55.265
until halfway through.

1083
00:50:55.605 --> 00:50:59.385
Uh, just, just, uh, just but allow that process to happen.

1084
00:50:59.475 --> 00:51:01.465
Allow that internal experience for you

1085
00:51:01.465 --> 00:51:02.665
to then discover what that is.

1086
00:51:02.775 --> 00:51:07.185
Like if for you to be, uh,

1087
00:51:07.505 --> 00:51:10.705
a singer and a performer, find that thing

1088
00:51:10.705 --> 00:51:13.955
that makes this scary find, uh,

1089
00:51:14.035 --> 00:51:15.195
I think that's gonna be my suggestion.

1090
00:51:15.195 --> 00:51:16.635
Find the thing that makes this scary,

1091
00:51:16.975 --> 00:51:19.235
but then find the thing, find the energy

1092
00:51:19.235 --> 00:51:21.955
and the reason to why you being a performer makes

1093
00:51:22.055 --> 00:51:23.075
the most sense to you.

1094
00:51:24.055 --> 00:51:26.555
And if you can find those two things, there's your story.

1095
00:51:27.605 --> 00:51:29.305
Okay. Thank you so much.

1096
00:51:29.925 --> 00:51:32.225
You're welcome. Oh, hi to Eric.

1097
00:51:34.745 --> 00:51:36.005
Hey Hayden. How are you man?

1098
00:51:36.345 --> 00:51:37.345
I'm doing great. How you doing?

1099
00:51:37.795 --> 00:51:42.175
Good. So, um, here, let me lower my hand so I don't, um,

1100
00:51:42.325 --> 00:51:47.075
anyways, uh, really good, really good content.

1101
00:51:47.135 --> 00:51:48.675
And I love the angle from storytelling.

1102
00:51:48.775 --> 00:51:52.835
We hear a lot in business, specifically in B2B sales,

1103
00:51:53.015 --> 00:51:56.155
one business selling to another that there's really no room

1104
00:51:56.215 --> 00:51:59.115
for story within the B2B ecosystem.

1105
00:51:59.675 --> 00:52:00.915
I completely disagree with that.

1106
00:52:01.115 --> 00:52:02.395
I think humans buy from humans.

1107
00:52:02.495 --> 00:52:05.115
We no longer buy the logo, the logo is secondary.

1108
00:52:05.135 --> 00:52:06.555
We buy from human beings first.

1109
00:52:06.825 --> 00:52:09.675
There's a ton of emotion and a ton of opportunity for story.

1110
00:52:10.575 --> 00:52:12.675
How would you transform the things that you do

1111
00:52:12.695 --> 00:52:14.235
for the business professionals out there?

1112
00:52:14.655 --> 00:52:17.035
How would you encourage them to start to tell story

1113
00:52:17.135 --> 00:52:19.275
around their brand so that it resonates

1114
00:52:19.275 --> 00:52:22.715
and drives emotion with a business purchase?

1115
00:52:24.035 --> 00:52:26.645
Well, uh, one of the best salesmen

1116
00:52:26.905 --> 00:52:28.325
to ever exist was Steve Jobs.

1117
00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:31.285
Uh, and the main reason was he never sold the product.

1118
00:52:31.345 --> 00:52:33.765
He sold the story, he sold the idea, he sold the feeling.

1119
00:52:34.545 --> 00:52:37.085
Uh, that was, it was, he always followed

1120
00:52:37.085 --> 00:52:39.125
that same philosophy, is give,

1121
00:52:39.395 --> 00:52:41.125
give people a product they didn't know

1122
00:52:41.125 --> 00:52:42.285
they've, they always wanted.

1123
00:52:43.065 --> 00:52:46.845
Uh, and, uh, and so one of the be and uh,

1124
00:52:46.845 --> 00:52:50.065
and on top of that, um, one of the best

1125
00:52:50.085 --> 00:52:52.185
and most funniest things of marketing

1126
00:52:52.245 --> 00:52:54.985
and selling brands is with perfumes

1127
00:52:55.095 --> 00:52:57.105
because smellovision doesn't exist.

1128
00:52:57.525 --> 00:53:00.545
And so what do they do? They have to then create the feeling

1129
00:53:00.605 --> 00:53:02.065
of what that perfume can do.

1130
00:53:02.645 --> 00:53:04.305
And so they can create something cinematic,

1131
00:53:04.305 --> 00:53:05.385
they create something intimate.

1132
00:53:05.385 --> 00:53:07.665
They have Tim Timothy Charlemagne going, Ooh, and ooh,

1133
00:53:07.665 --> 00:53:08.785
and giving, doing those little faces

1134
00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:10.785
because they're trying to generate the feeling, right?

1135
00:53:10.805 --> 00:53:12.265
And you then in,

1136
00:53:12.405 --> 00:53:14.865
and then I see those ads and go, wow, that's cool.

1137
00:53:14.945 --> 00:53:18.305
I want to create that feeling. And now I buy Prada perfume

1138
00:53:18.345 --> 00:53:19.825
because Timothy Charlemagne was in it.

1139
00:53:20.485 --> 00:53:23.215
Um, so you are,

1140
00:53:24.115 --> 00:53:25.725
people always say you gotta sell the story,

1141
00:53:25.725 --> 00:53:27.405
whereas actually read my red

1142
00:53:27.405 --> 00:53:28.765
definition of it, you gotta sell the feeling.

1143
00:53:29.385 --> 00:53:33.285
Uh, my brand is, and my brand is curiosity.

1144
00:53:33.505 --> 00:53:37.415
Uh, my brand is what we do on YouTube is really dumb,

1145
00:53:37.835 --> 00:53:39.375
and these traditional people have figured it out.

1146
00:53:39.375 --> 00:53:41.255
So let's learn what they, let's learn what they're doing and

1147
00:53:41.255 --> 00:53:43.095
therefore, and then modernize

1148
00:53:43.095 --> 00:53:44.615
and then modernize it ourselves.

1149
00:53:45.195 --> 00:53:48.575
My, my brand is retention, editing is dumb as hell.

1150
00:53:48.675 --> 00:53:50.095
Uh, here's how to make people care.

1151
00:53:50.565 --> 00:53:51.855
It's like you understand that

1152
00:53:51.855 --> 00:53:53.575
because that's the feeling that I've generated

1153
00:53:53.575 --> 00:53:54.775
in the stories that I've told.

1154
00:53:55.275 --> 00:53:58.095
And so that's my focus in these B2B sales.

1155
00:53:58.095 --> 00:54:00.055
It's like, don't sell the business, sell the feeling.

1156
00:54:00.795 --> 00:54:05.735
Uh, and if you give me data and like these things

1157
00:54:06.195 --> 00:54:07.735
and like, here is data to prove

1158
00:54:07.735 --> 00:54:10.895
that the demand is huge, I don't care. I am bored.

1159
00:54:10.895 --> 00:54:15.295
Exactly. It's just to give me a euphoric feeling as

1160
00:54:15.295 --> 00:54:17.935
to why this makes the most sense for me to buy.

1161
00:54:18.865 --> 00:54:20.495
Right. And also appreciate you

1162
00:54:20.495 --> 00:54:22.535
because I've always had B2B sales

1163
00:54:22.555 --> 00:54:23.655
and I didn't know what that meant.

1164
00:54:23.675 --> 00:54:26.055
So now I know business to business sales. Now I know that.

1165
00:54:26.455 --> 00:54:28.855
So thanks for that. I had no idea what it meant.

1166
00:54:30.005 --> 00:54:32.855
Yeah, that's that's exactly right. Is is B2B sales.

1167
00:54:32.915 --> 00:54:34.535
And I, and I think you're right. It's a, it is a,

1168
00:54:34.685 --> 00:54:37.975
it's a move towards, it's not about the product, it's

1169
00:54:37.975 --> 00:54:39.215
what the product does.

1170
00:54:39.325 --> 00:54:40.575
Does it make your life easier?

1171
00:54:40.805 --> 00:54:42.975
Does it relieve tension and stress

1172
00:54:43.035 --> 00:54:44.615
and emotion outta your daily job?

1173
00:54:44.805 --> 00:54:47.095
Yeah. Does it keep you from getting fired by your boss?

1174
00:54:47.445 --> 00:54:48.495
Yeah, exactly.

1175
00:54:48.635 --> 00:54:51.855
Uh, I think we'll just figure about what is the feeling of,

1176
00:54:52.115 --> 00:54:54.015
uh, here, here, here's probably another good example.

1177
00:54:54.195 --> 00:54:56.775
Uh, the feeling of iPhones is some

1178
00:54:56.775 --> 00:54:59.015
of the most high tech people we know have it.

1179
00:54:59.075 --> 00:55:02.975
Uh, there's also that, um, everyone, mo Mo, some

1180
00:55:02.975 --> 00:55:05.215
of the best people we know are ones that own iPhones

1181
00:55:05.215 --> 00:55:06.255
and Apple products.

1182
00:55:06.255 --> 00:55:08.735
And so therefore, apple products have created a great brand

1183
00:55:08.735 --> 00:55:10.495
and feeling of productivity and success.

1184
00:55:11.195 --> 00:55:14.615
Uh, a few years ago, about four

1185
00:55:14.615 --> 00:55:18.175
or five years ago, Tesla had the best feeling

1186
00:55:18.435 --> 00:55:21.615
of high tech futurism with affordability.

1187
00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:24.375
Most people could afford a Tesla, but it, but, but

1188
00:55:24.375 --> 00:55:27.255
because Elon Musk had branded, had over promised, uh,

1189
00:55:27.255 --> 00:55:30.455
full self-driving that the Tesla cars felt like the future,

1190
00:55:31.035 --> 00:55:34.815
uh, transparently Elon's brand has definitely been changed.

1191
00:55:35.075 --> 00:55:39.575
And now, honestly, when I now see a Tesla, I kind of cringe

1192
00:55:39.575 --> 00:55:40.615
because I get reminded

1193
00:55:40.615 --> 00:55:42.415
of Elon Musk's behavior to past recently.

1194
00:55:42.635 --> 00:55:43.455
I'm sorry to make just a little,

1195
00:55:43.715 --> 00:55:44.815
little, yeah, just a little.

1196
00:55:44.995 --> 00:55:46.975
But now just a little. But, but,

1197
00:55:47.555 --> 00:55:50.175
but none of that was, we are now setting all

1198
00:55:50.175 --> 00:55:51.375
of these Teslas and all of that stuff.

1199
00:55:51.435 --> 00:55:52.855
It was just a feeling changed.

1200
00:55:53.555 --> 00:55:56.535
And now the brand of Tesla has been tainted.

1201
00:55:56.915 --> 00:56:00.335
Uh, and so it's, uh, and so it, that,

1202
00:56:00.355 --> 00:56:02.455
and all of that was just because of behavior.

1203
00:56:03.275 --> 00:56:04.895
Uh, uh, and that,

1204
00:56:04.955 --> 00:56:07.135
and the feeling generated by that behavior.

1205
00:56:07.195 --> 00:56:08.255
It is a relationship.

1206
00:56:08.395 --> 00:56:10.615
And so most importantly, what is, how,

1207
00:56:10.615 --> 00:56:13.015
what is a quality relationship that you're providing?

1208
00:56:13.565 --> 00:56:15.495
I've just realized, I've just realized I've got

1209
00:56:15.495 --> 00:56:17.495
that whole scary hand just behind me.

1210
00:56:17.495 --> 00:56:18.735
I've just, I thought that was quite it.

1211
00:56:18.855 --> 00:56:19.775
I just, I forgot about that.

1212
00:56:19.935 --> 00:56:20.935
I, that's, that's kind of funny.

1213
00:56:21.115 --> 00:56:23.365
But anyway, uh, that was a good chat. But yeah, thanks.

1214
00:56:23.365 --> 00:56:24.925
Thanks, thanks, Eric. I catch you around. Thanks

1215
00:56:24.925 --> 00:56:25.925
For taking my question. Hayden

1216
00:56:25.925 --> 00:56:27.525
Asie, thanks for putting me on stage.

1217
00:56:29.515 --> 00:56:31.845
Cool. I, I think I'll just do these last two, Matthew

1218
00:56:31.865 --> 00:56:33.485
and Sam, and then I think I've got a call it a day.

1219
00:56:36.355 --> 00:56:39.935
Um, let's see here. Hayden, hi

1220
00:56:39.935 --> 00:56:40.935
There. Uh,

1221
00:56:40.935 --> 00:56:41.975
uh, great.

1222
00:56:41.975 --> 00:56:43.455
Taking your course in creator now

1223
00:56:43.455 --> 00:56:45.135
and meeting you at Summit two years ago.

1224
00:56:45.355 --> 00:56:47.055
Oh, hell yeah. Um, my question

1225
00:56:47.055 --> 00:56:50.775
for you is more specific towards, uh, made for kids content.

1226
00:56:51.075 --> 00:56:54.575
Mm-hmm. How would you suggest I retain, uh,

1227
00:56:54.575 --> 00:56:57.655
their attention more with less retention editing?

1228
00:57:00.015 --> 00:57:02.955
Um, We also have on the project technical

1229
00:57:03.075 --> 00:57:07.755
Teams, so we've, Uh, through career and, uh, Michael,

1230
00:57:08.235 --> 00:57:10.155
I think kids content is a tough one.

1231
00:57:10.455 --> 00:57:13.155
Uh, and if I'm a little bit transparent, I'm not

1232
00:57:13.155 --> 00:57:15.635
that interested in kids content, so I'm having to,

1233
00:57:15.775 --> 00:57:17.395
I'm probably reserving my thoughts on it.

1234
00:57:18.095 --> 00:57:21.575
Uh, I think to an extent,

1235
00:57:22.525 --> 00:57:23.815
emotional intelligence

1236
00:57:23.955 --> 00:57:28.335
and wanting to invest into deeper storytelling doesn't

1237
00:57:28.335 --> 00:57:31.335
really begin to happen until they're mid-teens.

1238
00:57:32.095 --> 00:57:34.945
Whereas prior to that,

1239
00:57:35.265 --> 00:57:37.785
children are mostly interested in just bright colors

1240
00:57:37.965 --> 00:57:40.225
and loud noises.

1241
00:57:40.445 --> 00:57:45.225
And, uh, on side note, the, the, the official new,

1242
00:57:45.445 --> 00:57:46.865
uh, word that's ping

1243
00:57:46.865 --> 00:57:48.705
to put in a dictionary this year is brain rot.

1244
00:57:49.325 --> 00:57:51.225
Uh, I think that that, that,

1245
00:57:51.225 --> 00:57:52.825
that word has been officially coined now

1246
00:57:52.825 --> 00:57:54.505
and now is now is gonna be a dictionary.

1247
00:57:55.265 --> 00:57:57.105
I think majority of children

1248
00:57:58.125 --> 00:58:02.185
do not get interested in deeper content

1249
00:58:02.675 --> 00:58:04.505
until 12 to 13.

1250
00:58:04.765 --> 00:58:06.425
And so everything

1251
00:58:06.425 --> 00:58:09.465
that we have learned in retention editing is rele, is,

1252
00:58:09.625 --> 00:58:11.385
I would still say is relevant to them.

1253
00:58:12.045 --> 00:58:14.265
And, uh, I, I have to be honest, it kind

1254
00:58:14.265 --> 00:58:15.625
of breaks my heart a little bit, but I

1255
00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:16.865
think it's applicable to them.

1256
00:58:17.645 --> 00:58:20.105
Uh, however, though, the main thing

1257
00:58:20.105 --> 00:58:21.185
that I'm concerned about is

1258
00:58:21.185 --> 00:58:24.505
what are we teaching these children in terms of how to in,

1259
00:58:24.885 --> 00:58:27.145
in ingest content in later life?

1260
00:58:28.225 --> 00:58:32.685
I, uh, I, I, I think I have to stop myself there.

1261
00:58:32.845 --> 00:58:34.325
'cause I think, unfortunately, I think I have

1262
00:58:35.825 --> 00:58:39.405
too much controversial opinions on children's content.

1263
00:58:39.685 --> 00:58:41.445
I don't think I'm appropriate to answer this.

1264
00:58:41.465 --> 00:58:42.465
I'm afraid, Matthew.

1265
00:58:45.385 --> 00:58:46.475
Okay. Thank you, sir.

1266
00:58:47.255 --> 00:58:49.995
You're welcome. Anyways, uh, Sam,

1267
00:58:50.415 --> 00:58:53.275
and then since, since Eric came in on the last minute, I'll,

1268
00:58:53.275 --> 00:58:54.795
um, I'll, I'll answer that one,

1269
00:58:54.795 --> 00:58:56.795
but then I, Ben, then I got a call it. Hey, Sam.

1270
00:58:57.625 --> 00:59:00.555
Cool. Hey. Hey, Hayden. Uh, nice to meet you, man.

1271
00:59:00.555 --> 00:59:01.715
Thank you so much for the seminar.

1272
00:59:02.175 --> 00:59:04.395
Uh, appreciate the breakdown of Michelle's stuff.

1273
00:59:04.635 --> 00:59:08.235
I think she's really leading the charge on YouTube

1274
00:59:08.235 --> 00:59:09.395
storytelling and,

1275
00:59:09.495 --> 00:59:10.835
and the future of what

1276
00:59:11.485 --> 00:59:12.875
large scale content's gonna look like.

1277
00:59:12.935 --> 00:59:15.835
So I love, I love getting that look at her stuff.

1278
00:59:16.135 --> 00:59:17.875
Uh, I'm curious your thoughts.

1279
00:59:18.695 --> 00:59:22.615
Um, so we work for a theorist. Mm-hmm.

1280
00:59:22.715 --> 00:59:24.495
So we're doing like game theory, whatever,

1281
00:59:24.595 --> 00:59:28.615
but we're, we're looking at how we can incorporate more

1282
00:59:29.575 --> 00:59:32.615
storytelling elements into what is, you know,

1283
00:59:32.615 --> 00:59:34.655
quote unquote edutainment type content.

1284
00:59:34.915 --> 00:59:37.575
Mm. And some of the things we're rubbing up against is

1285
00:59:38.605 --> 00:59:42.535
finding micro moments, sort of like for ab

1286
00:59:43.105 --> 00:59:44.535
storylines throughout these videos.

1287
00:59:44.685 --> 00:59:45.935
Like you're clicking on a video

1288
00:59:46.075 --> 00:59:48.135
to learn about the science of something.

1289
00:59:48.715 --> 00:59:51.415
But we're, we're struggling with adding some of the

1290
00:59:51.985 --> 00:59:55.135
human element of storytelling that's gonna keep people

1291
00:59:55.675 --> 00:59:59.295
and endear them to some of our hosts in,

1292
00:59:59.355 --> 01:00:01.975
in a deeper level than just like, oh,

1293
01:00:01.975 --> 01:00:03.615
you tried this TikTok thing, it looked cool.

1294
01:00:03.805 --> 01:00:05.175
Yeah. And that's something

1295
01:00:05.175 --> 01:00:07.895
that we're really trying to dive deep into.

1296
01:00:07.955 --> 01:00:09.815
And you, I've really liked

1297
01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.055
what you said about Michelle's stuff.

1298
01:00:11.435 --> 01:00:13.895
Do you have any advice or thoughts

1299
01:00:13.895 --> 01:00:17.775
or things for us to try that would feel natural for that?

1300
01:00:18.735 --> 01:00:21.095
I, uh, well, first of all, great, great to meet you guys.

1301
01:00:21.115 --> 01:00:23.975
And also I've subscribed to all of the theory channels and,

1302
01:00:24.155 --> 01:00:26.055
and, and yeah, I've, I've always,

1303
01:00:26.165 --> 01:00:28.255
I've al I've always, always enjoyed the content.

1304
01:00:28.255 --> 01:00:29.535
That's actually been some of my favorite things.

1305
01:00:29.555 --> 01:00:31.055
But also, I will say, uh,

1306
01:00:31.125 --> 01:00:33.775
sometimes it is passive engagement.

1307
01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:35.855
It's, it's rather than active engagement.

1308
01:00:36.235 --> 01:00:38.695
But I think interesting now that you're trying

1309
01:00:38.695 --> 01:00:40.215
to invest into probably would be, uh,

1310
01:00:40.455 --> 01:00:41.655
a different elements of story.

1311
01:00:42.115 --> 01:00:43.575
Uh, especially I would've,

1312
01:00:43.815 --> 01:00:45.775
I would've very much now imagine you guys are trying

1313
01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.335
to move past the narrative of

1314
01:00:47.635 --> 01:00:49.135
how do you follow up with Matt Pat.

1315
01:00:49.515 --> 01:00:51.215
Mm-hmm. And then how can you then make sure,

1316
01:00:51.235 --> 01:00:54.135
get these people involved into you guys?

1317
01:00:54.755 --> 01:00:57.055
Uh, that is, that is a tremendous challenge.

1318
01:00:57.595 --> 01:01:00.135
Uh, I think then the,

1319
01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:03.305
and you guys have tried that, uh,

1320
01:01:03.325 --> 01:01:05.945
but it was like, Hey, I'm, we're not gonna replace Matt Pat,

1321
01:01:06.165 --> 01:01:07.545
but here is my energy.

1322
01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:10.635
Uh, and then, but, and then, uh,

1323
01:01:10.635 --> 01:01:12.755
this is a tough question, but I kinda love it.

1324
01:01:13.115 --> 01:01:14.715
I can, it's, uh, the,

1325
01:01:14.715 --> 01:01:16.355
the vibe I got when you're asking it is like,

1326
01:01:16.355 --> 01:01:18.035
this has been the question you guys' heads for the past,

1327
01:01:18.065 --> 01:01:19.475
like eight months or so.

1328
01:01:20.175 --> 01:01:23.755
Um, okay, let me think then.

1329
01:01:23.875 --> 01:01:25.195
I, I don't want, I don't, I don't wanna

1330
01:01:25.205 --> 01:01:26.435
brain vomit on this one.

1331
01:01:27.905 --> 01:01:32.285
I think for the presentation of it,

1332
01:01:32.385 --> 01:01:33.965
is there really space for it?

1333
01:01:33.965 --> 01:01:36.205
Because I have been trained to be passive.

1334
01:01:36.605 --> 01:01:38.005
I have been trained to be a passive watcher,

1335
01:01:38.005 --> 01:01:39.045
even though the animations of

1336
01:01:39.045 --> 01:01:40.805
that stuff is really, really great.

1337
01:01:42.205 --> 01:01:44.645
Hmm. I think

1338
01:01:49.765 --> 01:01:49.985
so.

1339
01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:52.105
Okay. How, how about this, um,

1340
01:01:56.285 --> 01:01:58.075
there, there's a video I'd like for you guys to watch

1341
01:01:58.735 --> 01:02:01.195
on my channel that, uh, that I did.

1342
01:02:01.195 --> 01:02:02.715
And I've been wanting to do more of these.

1343
01:02:03.135 --> 01:02:06.965
Um, when I would say you guys,

1344
01:02:08.815 --> 01:02:10.315
you give the evidence

1345
01:02:10.535 --> 01:02:13.955
and the story on the backend, like the conclusiveness of it.

1346
01:02:13.955 --> 01:02:15.115
Like, here's what we discovered.

1347
01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:19.845
Whereas I've always been curious if you're able

1348
01:02:19.845 --> 01:02:22.595
to tell stories of you are given the,

1349
01:02:22.665 --> 01:02:26.395
like you guys discover these conclusions or these ideas or,

1350
01:02:26.415 --> 01:02:28.355
or like, we see the process of your research

1351
01:02:29.015 --> 01:02:30.875
and then you then present that to us.

1352
01:02:31.495 --> 01:02:33.355
Uh, and I did that with a video

1353
01:02:33.355 --> 01:02:36.675
where I reviewed why Christopher's tenet was awful,

1354
01:02:36.855 --> 01:02:38.395
was an absolute garbage fire.

1355
01:02:39.095 --> 01:02:42.155
And we see me ask, we see me take calls with people

1356
01:02:42.255 --> 01:02:44.755
and ask questions of like, why was this,

1357
01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:45.995
why was this movie so bad?

1358
01:02:46.655 --> 01:02:47.955
And then I'm having a conversation

1359
01:02:48.175 --> 01:02:49.955
and then I have a revelation,

1360
01:02:49.955 --> 01:02:52.555
and then I like summarize the conclusion that I have.

1361
01:02:52.575 --> 01:02:56.835
And so documenting the process of you guys understanding

1362
01:02:57.095 --> 01:02:58.315
and finding that conclusion.

1363
01:02:58.815 --> 01:03:02.075
Um, another one for me, I'm finishing up editing a video

1364
01:03:03.325 --> 01:03:06.115
where, uh, where I worked for a client

1365
01:03:06.255 --> 01:03:08.955
and essentially, uh, I took a job.

1366
01:03:09.795 --> 01:03:12.195
I, I took a job where I was not qualified to do,

1367
01:03:12.275 --> 01:03:13.675
I did not have the skillset to do it.

1368
01:03:14.255 --> 01:03:18.195
And then the whole journey then became me actually trying

1369
01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:19.635
to step up to the plate and actually

1370
01:03:19.635 --> 01:03:20.675
pulled and pulled us off.

1371
01:03:20.675 --> 01:03:22.875
And I ended up doing it. And I documented my process

1372
01:03:23.215 --> 01:03:24.955
of them not realizing

1373
01:03:24.955 --> 01:03:26.715
that I didn't know how to do any of it.

1374
01:03:26.715 --> 01:03:28.715
Like, and then the theme I found was like, it was like,

1375
01:03:28.715 --> 01:03:29.835
it was a force accountability.

1376
01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:31.555
Take a job, you dunno how to do.

1377
01:03:32.255 --> 01:03:35.115
Uh, and so I would say, I wonder then if for,

1378
01:03:35.115 --> 01:03:37.715
for these theory channels, it's could there be more

1379
01:03:37.715 --> 01:03:41.875
of a present tense experience where could there,

1380
01:03:42.055 --> 01:03:45.115
and then discovering and then finding the conclusion.

1381
01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:46.955
And then essentially you take us on the journey,

1382
01:03:46.955 --> 01:03:49.075
you take a hand and you guide us through that

1383
01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:50.715
to discovery and conclusion.

1384
01:03:51.815 --> 01:03:54.655
Um, that it could be a direction.

1385
01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:57.695
I'm not sure the processes of you guys internally of like

1386
01:03:57.695 --> 01:03:59.655
how you guys do research and find that.

1387
01:04:00.235 --> 01:04:01.255
Um, but

1388
01:04:01.255 --> 01:04:03.455
that could just be an interesting flow and narrative.

1389
01:04:03.455 --> 01:04:05.095
And what this means is that we get

1390
01:04:05.095 --> 01:04:07.015
to see your guys' journey on,

1391
01:04:07.415 --> 01:04:08.735
I have a question that I don't know.

1392
01:04:09.275 --> 01:04:11.415
Follow me as I find this out myself,

1393
01:04:11.715 --> 01:04:14.135
and now I present to you the evidence to why this is true.

1394
01:04:15.115 --> 01:04:16.775
Um, could be an, and then

1395
01:04:16.775 --> 01:04:18.415
therefore I spend time with you on a

1396
01:04:18.575 --> 01:04:19.775
personal journey on that.

1397
01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:22.675
I, I wonder, uh, I wonder if,

1398
01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:24.555
and I wonder if that style

1399
01:04:24.615 --> 01:04:26.955
of investigation could be interesting for you guys.

1400
01:04:28.975 --> 01:04:31.505
Yeah, absolutely. I think that makes a ton of sense.

1401
01:04:31.605 --> 01:04:34.345
And I know, like you said, we, it's, it's a big question

1402
01:04:34.345 --> 01:04:35.865
that we're noodling on

1403
01:04:35.885 --> 01:04:38.305
and you know, I think you do a really

1404
01:04:38.305 --> 01:04:39.505
good job with a lot of this stuff.

1405
01:04:39.525 --> 01:04:40.665
So I wanted to hear your thoughts,

1406
01:04:40.685 --> 01:04:42.865
but yeah, we didn't want to, you know,

1407
01:04:42.865 --> 01:04:44.945
throw too much at you, but we appreciate your thoughts.

1408
01:04:45.585 --> 01:04:48.585
I I, this is a deeper conversation I would love

1409
01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:51.185
to explore on reach out, reach out to me on Instagram

1410
01:04:51.185 --> 01:04:52.865
or Twitter or something and let's have

1411
01:04:52.865 --> 01:04:53.985
deeper conversations about this.

1412
01:04:54.785 --> 01:04:55.865
A hundred percent. We will.

1413
01:04:56.195 --> 01:04:58.625
Great catch, catch your out mate. Anyway, last one.

1414
01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:00.665
Eric, how you doing? Got good to meet you guys.

1415
01:05:00.665 --> 01:05:01.945
Eric, how you doing? Good.

1416
01:05:01.945 --> 01:05:03.545
How are you? Um, doing?

1417
01:05:03.615 --> 01:05:07.065
Yeah, so I'm, uh, I shoot and edit everything myself.

1418
01:05:07.565 --> 01:05:10.225
And so I'm curious if you have one you look

1419
01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:13.265
to on a smaller scale without a production team.

1420
01:05:13.365 --> 01:05:15.225
Mm-hmm. Uh, did I, can you hear me?

1421
01:05:15.335 --> 01:05:16.545
Yeah, I can. I can. Okay. Sweet.

1422
01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:17.885
I was, I was just, I was just thinking, I think,

1423
01:05:17.885 --> 01:05:19.805
I think some people, I think some people sent me your videos

1424
01:05:19.805 --> 01:05:20.845
yesterday actually.

1425
01:05:21.715 --> 01:05:23.455
Oh, no way. Hold on.

1426
01:05:23.455 --> 01:05:24.655
Lemme lemme, lemme just triple check.

1427
01:05:24.935 --> 01:05:26.175
'cause I did a tweet asking, well, some

1428
01:05:26.175 --> 01:05:28.255
of the best YouTube un unless I'm confusing your face

1429
01:05:28.255 --> 01:05:29.575
with someone else, let me see

1430
01:05:30.735 --> 01:05:32.515
My, uh, channel's Porter, MTB.

1431
01:05:32.775 --> 01:05:35.155
So it's, uh, like mountain bike stuff

1432
01:05:35.195 --> 01:05:36.315
a lot of times with my kids.

1433
01:05:36.705 --> 01:05:37.835
Okay. Mi you, you,

1434
01:05:37.835 --> 01:05:39.115
you look like you I might

1435
01:05:39.115 --> 01:05:40.715
have mistaken you for someone else then. I'm so sorry.

1436
01:05:41.135 --> 01:05:42.435
Oh no, it's all right. I get, uh,

1437
01:05:42.435 --> 01:05:45.355
you know what's funny is the, um, outdoor boys, uh,

1438
01:05:45.355 --> 01:05:48.075
this guy Luke that does that channel from Alaska, like,

1439
01:05:49.255 --> 01:05:50.355
he gets crazy views

1440
01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:53.795
and just goes out camping, like super minimal editing

1441
01:05:53.975 --> 01:05:55.435
and just does some adventure.

1442
01:05:55.695 --> 01:05:57.765
Um, oh yeah. Which, anyway,

1443
01:05:57.765 --> 01:05:59.205
that's probably what you got sent. Um,

1444
01:05:59.625 --> 01:06:02.645
And it was, I found it, it was a creator called Ali Gallup

1445
01:06:02.645 --> 01:06:06.405
that I, but, but that you happened to have similar look to

1446
01:06:07.245 --> 01:06:09.885
anyway, uh, let's, let's, let's start this again anyway,

1447
01:06:09.885 --> 01:06:11.485
let's like, Hey, Eric, what, what's your question?

1448
01:06:12.315 --> 01:06:15.845
Yeah, so I was curious, um, if you have anyone you look to

1449
01:06:16.225 --> 01:06:19.125
for really good examples of storytelling, uh,

1450
01:06:19.235 --> 01:06:21.685
without the super high production value

1451
01:06:22.305 --> 01:06:23.605
of like Michelle Curry

1452
01:06:24.025 --> 01:06:26.645
and related to that question, um,

1453
01:06:27.385 --> 01:06:28.445
I'm in the mountain bike space

1454
01:06:28.445 --> 01:06:30.685
and a lot of creators, you know, through their journey,

1455
01:06:31.265 --> 01:06:32.965
you keep trying to up the production value

1456
01:06:33.305 --> 01:06:35.085
and make it as good as possible

1457
01:06:35.085 --> 01:06:36.445
with in every way that you can.

1458
01:06:36.945 --> 01:06:40.085
And it seems like that was working really well,

1459
01:06:40.085 --> 01:06:41.245
especially when Netflix

1460
01:06:41.585 --> 01:06:43.525
and through Covid when they couldn't

1461
01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:44.965
put anything out, you know?

1462
01:06:44.965 --> 01:06:47.685
Yeah. And now that they're back on track

1463
01:06:47.705 --> 01:06:51.765
and there's tons of stuff on tv, uh, I get the feeling

1464
01:06:51.765 --> 01:06:55.285
that people are going to YouTube for more real.

1465
01:06:55.515 --> 01:06:59.005
Yeah. You know? And so just curious thoughts on that

1466
01:06:59.105 --> 01:07:01.445
and people you look to, you know, as kind of

1467
01:07:02.295 --> 01:07:03.715
single creator editors.

1468
01:07:04.025 --> 01:07:06.355
Yeah, I think there is, well, that, that's one

1469
01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.355
of the best parts about YouTube.

1470
01:07:07.355 --> 01:07:08.475
Like, I can talk about Mr. Beast,

1471
01:07:08.595 --> 01:07:09.755
I can talk about Michelle Carre

1472
01:07:09.755 --> 01:07:10.915
and you had that high production quality,

1473
01:07:11.295 --> 01:07:13.435
but they also have a really, really good, I'm trying

1474
01:07:13.435 --> 01:07:14.635
to fix my iPhone thing.

1475
01:07:14.635 --> 01:07:17.715
There we go. No, go this way. There we go. Now it's fixed.

1476
01:07:18.095 --> 01:07:19.555
Uh, and then, uh, I was,

1477
01:07:20.555 --> 01:07:22.335
but then also there is the much more

1478
01:07:22.615 --> 01:07:24.095
grounded, uh, side of it.

1479
01:07:24.715 --> 01:07:27.615
Uh, there is just one creator at the top on the tip

1480
01:07:27.615 --> 01:07:30.655
of my tongue who is just very grounded

1481
01:07:30.835 --> 01:07:32.015
and hangs out with someone.

1482
01:07:32.435 --> 01:07:34.255
Uh, uh, it's, it's a cliche at the moment,

1483
01:07:34.355 --> 01:07:35.855
and I didn't find him that interesting,

1484
01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:38.375
but a lot of creators start talking about Sam

1485
01:07:38.595 --> 01:07:39.655
Suk last this year.

1486
01:07:40.395 --> 01:07:41.935
Uh, and, but, uh, but, and,

1487
01:07:41.955 --> 01:07:44.415
and I think people really liked just hanging out with him,

1488
01:07:44.515 --> 01:07:47.415
but also to an extent that was just, yeah,

1489
01:07:47.435 --> 01:07:50.825
he just had a great energy that you would want

1490
01:07:50.825 --> 01:07:51.865
to hang out with this person.

1491
01:07:52.565 --> 01:07:53.865
Uh, I think that's why

1492
01:07:53.865 --> 01:07:56.265
so many people tune into these streamers like Kai Sunnet

1493
01:07:56.265 --> 01:07:58.745
and is show speed because they are just,

1494
01:07:58.745 --> 01:08:00.065
there's something about their energy.

1495
01:08:00.065 --> 01:08:02.905
There's something that's so unpredictable and just exciting.

1496
01:08:02.905 --> 01:08:04.945
Like what stupid crazy things gonna happen

1497
01:08:05.135 --> 01:08:06.145
next with these guys?

1498
01:08:07.005 --> 01:08:10.955
And I think the main thing is, if you are,

1499
01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:13.675
the main thing is for you guys then is the, it is

1500
01:08:13.675 --> 01:08:16.725
to develop skills in giving me that quality time.

1501
01:08:17.425 --> 01:08:20.485
Uh, are you the most interesting person I can

1502
01:08:20.485 --> 01:08:21.565
hang out with this evening?

1503
01:08:22.245 --> 01:08:24.285
I love mountain biking. I, I love hiking.

1504
01:08:24.525 --> 01:08:25.765
I love going into the mountains.

1505
01:08:26.385 --> 01:08:28.285
Why are you the person I want to go

1506
01:08:28.285 --> 01:08:30.605
and hang out in the mountains with you?

1507
01:08:31.425 --> 01:08:33.285
And, and then that type of journey.

1508
01:08:33.545 --> 01:08:36.085
So I don't think cinematic production quality is

1509
01:08:36.085 --> 01:08:37.285
particularly that interesting.

1510
01:08:37.745 --> 01:08:40.525
But if you, uh, let's just say for me,

1511
01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:42.245
I'm not a particularly well traveled person,

1512
01:08:42.705 --> 01:08:45.845
but if you are able to take me on a journey through Big Bear

1513
01:08:46.145 --> 01:08:49.525
or Utah or anywhere like that, where it gives me the feeling

1514
01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:53.405
that I did spend time with you and the,

1515
01:08:53.705 --> 01:08:54.845
and these environments

1516
01:08:55.315 --> 01:08:57.485
that groundedness is really, really important.

1517
01:08:58.225 --> 01:09:01.605
I'm trying to think of a creator that does that pretty well.

1518
01:09:02.345 --> 01:09:06.205
Um, well, I would say another way of putting it is the more

1519
01:09:06.745 --> 01:09:09.125
of a per, more of a great person you are to hang out with,

1520
01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.845
the less cinematic you have to be.

1521
01:09:11.505 --> 01:09:15.045
Uh, a lot of creators compensate with cinematic stuff.

1522
01:09:15.915 --> 01:09:19.655
Uh, God, the amount of f*****g travel creators that just do

1523
01:09:19.885 --> 01:09:22.175
that, that, that look really good

1524
01:09:22.795 --> 01:09:24.735
and with like the most ridiculous s***s

1525
01:09:24.835 --> 01:09:26.535
and the most gorgeous drone shots.

1526
01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:28.895
And they all these slow motion shots

1527
01:09:28.895 --> 01:09:30.695
of them walking up these hikes

1528
01:09:31.075 --> 01:09:32.815
and in the end, nothing f*****g happens.

1529
01:09:33.515 --> 01:09:35.175
And it's like, I don't care.

1530
01:09:35.555 --> 01:09:37.215
Uh, I want to hang out with you.

1531
01:09:37.915 --> 01:09:42.295
Um, so I would even say like, not if you,

1532
01:09:42.395 --> 01:09:44.855
if you are just a genuinely great person to spend time with,

1533
01:09:44.855 --> 01:09:47.695
you do not have to go high production quality with it

1534
01:09:48.435 --> 01:09:50.295
in terms of, you don't have to make this cinematic,

1535
01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:51.695
but if you can make it feel real,

1536
01:09:51.915 --> 01:09:53.055
that's probably the main thing.

1537
01:09:53.295 --> 01:09:56.615
I just, it's a hard answer to give, uh,

1538
01:09:56.965 --> 01:09:59.055
because basically instead of having

1539
01:09:59.055 --> 01:10:01.055
to build skills on cinematic stuff,

1540
01:10:01.105 --> 01:10:04.335
build skills on your personality is, is, is the,

1541
01:10:04.395 --> 01:10:06.055
is the summary of what I'm trying to say.

1542
01:10:06.915 --> 01:10:10.285
Yeah. And I mean, I still look to like, say even

1543
01:10:10.305 --> 01:10:12.845
for retention techniques, like Casey iat for,

1544
01:10:13.355 --> 01:10:14.725
he's not telling you to keep watching,

1545
01:10:14.725 --> 01:10:16.565
but he is giving you reasons Yeah.

1546
01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:18.365
Through the video to keep watching.

1547
01:10:18.705 --> 01:10:20.805
But we forget half the video, half of the videos

1548
01:10:20.865 --> 01:10:23.005
of Casey iStat was him going to the bloody dentist.

1549
01:10:23.585 --> 01:10:25.245
But yeah, we were enthralled.

1550
01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:29.885
It's like he had, and it, and it wasn't the music

1551
01:10:29.945 --> 01:10:32.285
and the drone shots and the time lapses, it was

1552
01:10:32.905 --> 01:10:34.685
his perspective of life.

1553
01:10:35.305 --> 01:10:38.645
Uh, people tuned into Logan because, uh, Logan Paul,

1554
01:10:38.645 --> 01:10:41.245
because we all, we all enjoyed seeing his

1555
01:10:41.315 --> 01:10:42.725
perspective of the world.

1556
01:10:43.345 --> 01:10:47.125
We enjoyed the fact that he saw the world as a playground

1557
01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:49.485
and he did anything he wanted with it.

1558
01:10:49.835 --> 01:10:51.885
Same thing with Kai and Isha Speed.

1559
01:10:51.885 --> 01:10:54.285
People are tuning in because they love the fact

1560
01:10:54.285 --> 01:10:55.765
that the world is their playground.

1561
01:10:56.345 --> 01:10:58.805
Uh, Peter McKinnon, it's like, we like

1562
01:10:58.805 --> 01:11:01.125
to see his perspective of the world of,

1563
01:11:01.565 --> 01:11:03.605
I can make anything look beautiful.

1564
01:11:04.075 --> 01:11:06.405
There's there, there's an eclipse happening.

1565
01:11:06.675 --> 01:11:08.685
F**k yeah, let's get two Red Bull planes

1566
01:11:08.685 --> 01:11:10.845
to fly over the exact same time that eclipse is happening.

1567
01:11:10.845 --> 01:11:12.285
Hell yeah. I wanna see that perspective.

1568
01:11:12.985 --> 01:11:17.045
And so if your perspective of the world is genuinely unique

1569
01:11:17.045 --> 01:11:18.565
and beautiful, uh,

1570
01:11:18.705 --> 01:11:21.845
and then Casey Nys stat did a phenomenal job making Night

1571
01:11:22.025 --> 01:11:25.725
New York look beautiful, whereas most other creators,

1572
01:11:26.195 --> 01:11:28.085
whereas a lot of, a lot of people show how,

1573
01:11:28.225 --> 01:11:29.725
how ugly New York can be.

1574
01:11:30.425 --> 01:11:33.765
So if you can show the world a computer, uh, Bob Ross,

1575
01:11:33.825 --> 01:11:37.365
the painter, we all tuned into Bob Ross because his optimism

1576
01:11:37.865 --> 01:11:39.885
and hope was so infectious.

1577
01:11:40.955 --> 01:11:43.215
You know, it's, it's, I think

1578
01:11:43.215 --> 01:11:45.935
that if you can figure out your perspective of the world

1579
01:11:46.715 --> 01:11:47.895
and then you share that,

1580
01:11:48.735 --> 01:11:51.075
that's gonna make anyone wanna tune in and stay with you.

1581
01:11:53.025 --> 01:11:54.645
Cool. Thank you.

1582
01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:57.905
All right. With that though, guys, I think we're kind

1583
01:11:57.905 --> 01:11:58.985
