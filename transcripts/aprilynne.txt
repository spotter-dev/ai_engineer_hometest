00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:22.675
to make a killer intro.

8
00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:25.115
So a little bit about April Lynn, I'll just,

9
00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:27.355
I wrote a little bio about her, so I wanted to share it

10
00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:29.195
with you guys, um, to introduce her.

11
00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:31.715
And then I'll pass it off to April Lynn to take us through

12
00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:32.875
what she has for us today.

13
00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:35.395
But I'm excited to introduce April Lynn,

14
00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:37.355
an amazing content creator, uh,

15
00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:39.875
and YouTube strategist who's built a name for herself

16
00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.715
by breaking down what actually works on YouTube.

17
00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.795
So you guys are in for a treat today.

18
00:00:45.175 --> 00:00:48.435
So she coins herself as just a girl who loves YouTube,

19
00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:50.635
but we all know that you're more than that April Lyn.

20
00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.915
Um, and today she's gonna be taking us through how

21
00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:54.915
to make a killer intro

22
00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:56.995
and this session, um,

23
00:00:56.995 --> 00:00:59.715
she's gonna be talking about breaking down the psychology

24
00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:03.115
and strategies behind the high retention videos

25
00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:04.835
that keep viewers watching.

26
00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:07.555
So April, Lynn, it's such a pleasure to have you on today

27
00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:08.715
and I'm gonna pass it on to you.

28
00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:11.635
Thank you so much for having me.

29
00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:15.115
And hello everyone, super stoked. Talk about intros.

30
00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:18.315
Lemme get started by just sharing my screen.

31
00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:21.975
Let's go ahead and jump into that right now.

32
00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:29.085
All right, everyone see everything? Perfect.

33
00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:30.845
Well, hello.

34
00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:33.045
Good morning or afternoon

35
00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:35.045
or evening depending on where you're tuning in from.

36
00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:38.365
Speaking of which, uh, okay.

37
00:01:38.575 --> 00:01:40.685
Can't hear anything, I'm assuming I'm good though.

38
00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:44.525
Um, but as you come in, go ahead and put in the chat.

39
00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:48.605
So where, where you're from, how long you've been on YouTube

40
00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:51.205
for, and on a scale of one to 10,

41
00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:53.765
where would you rate your current confidence level

42
00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:55.845
with YouTube intros?

43
00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:00.405
Um, yeah, so as you've roll in, maybe as we can figure out,

44
00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:03.125
uh, audio for Darren as well, just go ahead

45
00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:05.685
and put your answers in the chat.

46
00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:10.365
Love to hear. Four months. Wow. Awesome. 1.5 K followers.

47
00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:12.965
That's amazing for four months. Great to see you Lael.

48
00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:16.685
Uh, Cody. Hi, new Newfoundland, Canada. Wow.

49
00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:18.325
I am assuming very cold.

50
00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:20.085
I think you guys have gotten a lot of snow recently.

51
00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:22.725
Um, two months, um,

52
00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:25.605
and a scale of two when it comes to confidence.

53
00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:26.885
Well, welcome to YouTube.

54
00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:29.605
So glad to have you and hopefully we can get

55
00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:31.005
that number a little bit higher

56
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:32.685
through the course of this workshop.

57
00:02:33.815 --> 00:02:38.565
Great. I'm just going to set a little timer for myself so

58
00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.125
I can keep myself on track.

59
00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:41.765
And Edmonton, I don't know

60
00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:43.685
where Edmonton is, but two-ish months.

61
00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:44.685
Awesome. Great.

62
00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:49.325
Another newcomer to, uh, to YouTube

63
00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:53.575
and 150 is a bit over the scale,

64
00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:58.415
so either incredibly confident with intros, uh, or a typo.

65
00:02:58.515 --> 00:02:59.685
But welcome and again,

66
00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:01.805
hopefully we can get these numbers a little bit higher

67
00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:03.885
throughout the course of this workshop.

68
00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:07.685
And we'll start off with some introductions,

69
00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:11.165
but, uh, people introductions, not video introductions.

70
00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:13.485
So, hi, I am April Lynn

71
00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:16.165
and I've been on YouTube as a whole for three

72
00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:18.765
and a half years at this point, which is kind of insane

73
00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:20.005
to think about going on four.

74
00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:23.845
And during this time I've started three channels, um,

75
00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:25.485
brought in millions of views

76
00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:28.645
and I feel like now I have the best job in the world,

77
00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:30.925
which is essentially just getting to learn all about YouTube

78
00:03:30.945 --> 00:03:32.365
and just share what I learn.

79
00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:36.045
I've helped tens of thousands of creators on the strategies

80
00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:37.405
that top YouTubers learn how to grow.

81
00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:41.605
Um, and my videos, which depending on

82
00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:44.005
how many YouTube strategy videos you tend

83
00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:45.885
to watch in your personal time may

84
00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:47.765
or may not have shown up on your YouTube recommended

85
00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:49.165
at some point in the journey.

86
00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:54.045
Um, these have circulated as training materials for some

87
00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:56.365
of the teams of the biggest creators in the world, which is,

88
00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:58.045
again, crazy to think about.

89
00:03:58.595 --> 00:04:00.325
I've been told that some of these videos have served

90
00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:01.805
as like the basis for frameworks

91
00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:03.045
and standard operating procedures

92
00:04:03.045 --> 00:04:04.925
that are adopted in some of these large teams.

93
00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:08.765
But today I'm here to train you

94
00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:12.605
and we're gonna be talking about the single most underrated

95
00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:16.085
part of a YouTube video, which is the intro.

96
00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:19.845
And this is the party video that tends

97
00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:21.525
to see the largest drop off.

98
00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:23.765
But if you can improve the retention

99
00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:25.805
of these first 30 seconds, you'll

100
00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:26.885
by default improve the retention

101
00:04:26.985 --> 00:04:28.525
of the entire rest of your video.

102
00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.445
And your intro is quite special

103
00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:33.925
because it has the opportunity to make

104
00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:37.965
or break your video even if the rest of the video is killer.

105
00:04:38.155 --> 00:04:40.685
Because in order for someone to watch the rest of

106
00:04:40.685 --> 00:04:41.845
that killer video, they have

107
00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:43.205
to make it through your intro first.

108
00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:46.005
And if they end up clicking off within the first 30 seconds,

109
00:04:46.755 --> 00:04:48.805
then they won't stick around long enough

110
00:04:48.805 --> 00:04:52.285
to experience the rest of this killer, beautiful,

111
00:04:52.395 --> 00:04:54.325
amazing video that you have made.

112
00:04:54.945 --> 00:04:58.365
So no pressure, right on those first 30 seconds.

113
00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:01.725
Um, also Darren, so glad that you found the videos helpful.

114
00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:06.165
So yeah, how can we get our intros right?

115
00:05:06.835 --> 00:05:09.125
Well, there are many different ways to

116
00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:11.645
approach crafting a killer YouTube intro,

117
00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:14.205
but today we're gonna be covering a specific three

118
00:05:14.275 --> 00:05:15.365
step intro formula.

119
00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:19.525
And this formula has helped countless creators get

120
00:05:19.545 --> 00:05:20.565
one of tens in their videos.

121
00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:21.885
It's helped them hit six

122
00:05:21.885 --> 00:05:23.365
or seven figure view counts,

123
00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.165
has even helped channels become monetized.

124
00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:27.325
And it's a formula that can be applied

125
00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:29.685
to any video type across any niche.

126
00:05:30.075 --> 00:05:32.285
Once you learn it, you can use it to write intros for

127
00:05:32.845 --> 00:05:35.325
challenges, for tutorials, for vlogs, for video essays,

128
00:05:35.325 --> 00:05:37.445
really for anything that you want.

129
00:05:38.185 --> 00:05:41.965
And because the best way to learn is by doing today.

130
00:05:41.965 --> 00:05:43.485
We're not just gonna be learning the theory

131
00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:45.005
behind making killer intro,

132
00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:48.885
but we're going to write an intro together

133
00:05:49.825 --> 00:05:51.405
in this workshop today.

134
00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:55.865
And now, if you weren't prepared for this surprise,

135
00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:58.285
if you just thought, eh, I'm just gonna sit back, relax,

136
00:05:58.465 --> 00:06:01.045
listen to April and talk, no, I'm going to make you work.

137
00:06:01.425 --> 00:06:03.365
Uh, but we're gonna have a fun time doing it

138
00:06:03.365 --> 00:06:05.365
and we're going to learn a lot along the way.

139
00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.445
And it all starts with

140
00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:11.645
the first five seconds of your video.

141
00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:16.635
Now to minimize drop off from the very get go,

142
00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:18.035
your first five seconds.

143
00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:19.635
So what we're talking about, the first sentence

144
00:06:19.635 --> 00:06:23.075
of your intro should meet the expectations set

145
00:06:23.175 --> 00:06:24.515
by your title and thumbnail.

146
00:06:25.025 --> 00:06:27.035
What does that mean? What does that look like?

147
00:06:27.745 --> 00:06:31.155
Well, luckily for us, there's a very one simple tried

148
00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:34.035
and true method for doing this, which is simply

149
00:06:34.255 --> 00:06:37.115
to match your first sentence with your title.

150
00:06:37.695 --> 00:06:38.955
Um, to show you what I mean,

151
00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:40.275
let's take a look at an example.

152
00:06:40.975 --> 00:06:43.605
So this is a YouTube video

153
00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:46.165
from you all recognize him, Mr.

154
00:06:46.175 --> 00:06:50.285
Beast. And it's titled, beat Ronaldo Win $1 million.

155
00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:53.165
Now as you're looking at this, you as a viewer can start

156
00:06:53.165 --> 00:06:55.085
to picture, well, what do you, what sort

157
00:06:55.085 --> 00:06:58.365
of expectations do you have when looking at this packaging,

158
00:06:58.365 --> 00:06:59.765
when looking at this title and thumbnail?

159
00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:01.885
What do you expect the video is going to be about?

160
00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:06.565
And keep those expectations in mind as we go into,

161
00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:10.055
don't see my, don't see my shared screen.

162
00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:15.155
Um, have you seen my presentation this whole time?

163
00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:20.485
No, I, oh, okay. Sorry. No, people see it. I don't see it.

164
00:07:20.525 --> 00:07:22.245
I mean, 'cause I'm a cohost with you,

165
00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:24.525
but I was just making sure that everybody saw it.

166
00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:26.405
Okay, if everyone sees it, that is fantastic.

167
00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:30.325
Perfect. Um, great, glad people can see that.

168
00:07:30.505 --> 00:07:32.765
So yeah, keep those expectations in mind

169
00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:36.885
as we take a look at the first sentence.

170
00:07:37.885 --> 00:07:41.025
If, if this subscriber can be Ronaldo in a one v one,

171
00:07:41.325 --> 00:07:43.105
I'm going to give him a million dollars.

172
00:07:44.335 --> 00:07:46.145
Alright, that's the first sentence.

173
00:07:46.295 --> 00:07:49.425
What do we think if this and what do we have here?

174
00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:51.985
So in one sentence, we have,

175
00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:54.785
if this subscriber can beat Ronaldo in a one v one,

176
00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:56.345
I'm going to give him a million dollars.

177
00:07:56.725 --> 00:07:57.745
Pretty straightforward.

178
00:07:57.965 --> 00:08:00.425
But he clearly meets the expectations set

179
00:08:00.725 --> 00:08:02.145
by the title and thumbnail.

180
00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:03.625
We clearly immediately get,

181
00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:05.305
if someone clicked on this video from Mr.

182
00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:08.705
Beast, they see, they hear this very first sentence,

183
00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:11.065
they're gonna be like, heck freaking, yeah,

184
00:08:11.065 --> 00:08:12.505
this is exactly what I came for.

185
00:08:12.505 --> 00:08:13.745
This is exactly what I want.

186
00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:15.705
They have no reason to click off at this point.

187
00:08:15.705 --> 00:08:16.945
They're going to keep watching.

188
00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:20.295
So I know this one matches pretty similarly

189
00:08:20.405 --> 00:08:21.535
with the title here,

190
00:08:21.715 --> 00:08:23.095
but let's take a look at another example.

191
00:08:23.765 --> 00:08:26.295
This is a video from Answer in Progress.

192
00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:29.575
Um, and the title here is Why Women's Pockets are Useless,

193
00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:31.695
which I mean, preach absolutely

194
00:08:31.865 --> 00:08:33.455
great question in certain progress.

195
00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:37.375
Uh, so let's take a look at the first sentence

196
00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:39.455
of their video.

197
00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.585
Women's Pockets, if they even exist,

198
00:08:44.735 --> 00:08:47.625
they are usually too small to hold anything useful.

199
00:08:48.845 --> 00:08:50.265
All right, what do we have here?

200
00:08:51.015 --> 00:08:54.625
Well, women's pockets, if they exist, are usually too small

201
00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:57.485
to hold anything useful as you can see in order

202
00:08:57.485 --> 00:08:58.925
to meet the expectations set by their title

203
00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:01.565
and thumbnail you in your first seconds,

204
00:09:01.665 --> 00:09:03.605
you don't in your first five seconds, you don't have

205
00:09:03.605 --> 00:09:06.485
to like match your title word for word,

206
00:09:07.225 --> 00:09:09.285
but it should be close enough so

207
00:09:09.285 --> 00:09:10.765
that if someone sees a title

208
00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:13.405
and thumbnail that they like, they click into it

209
00:09:13.745 --> 00:09:16.925
and they feel like, oh, this is the video that I expected.

210
00:09:16.995 --> 00:09:18.685
This is the video that I was promised.

211
00:09:18.915 --> 00:09:20.845
This is a video that feels worth watching.

212
00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:22.645
Because let's say for instance,

213
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.845
you're making a video about bullet journaling for 30 days.

214
00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:28.885
If your first sentence doesn't mention the word bullet

215
00:09:28.885 --> 00:09:31.805
journal or the word 30 days, people are either going

216
00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:33.405
to get confused or we'll assume

217
00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:34.845
that your video is full of fluff.

218
00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:36.845
And so they're going to click off.

219
00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:40.645
The goal is to mention enough main action words

220
00:09:40.785 --> 00:09:43.485
of your title to assure your viewers that your title

221
00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:45.205
and thumbnail wasn't, wasn't click bait,

222
00:09:45.235 --> 00:09:46.845
that they will receive what they clicked for.

223
00:09:47.265 --> 00:09:50.165
And also so that when they hop in, they know

224
00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:52.405
that you are going to respect their time.

225
00:09:52.555 --> 00:09:54.605
It's going to be a video that gives 'em what they promise,

226
00:09:54.715 --> 00:09:56.045
what, what, what, what was promised,

227
00:09:56.385 --> 00:10:00.405
and do so in a way that doesn't have a lot of extra stuff do

228
00:10:00.405 --> 00:10:01.525
so in a way that's effective

229
00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:02.885
and doing so in a way that again,

230
00:10:02.885 --> 00:10:04.645
respects their time as a viewer.

231
00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:07.875
So essentially to the title should summarize

232
00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:09.235
or state the promise purpose,

233
00:10:10.195 --> 00:10:11.635
absolutely Cody, a hundred percent.

234
00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:17.135
And as you might realize, in order to write a sentence that

235
00:10:18.025 --> 00:10:19.855
meets the expectations set by the title

236
00:10:19.855 --> 00:10:22.415
and thumbnail, you need to have a title

237
00:10:22.415 --> 00:10:24.455
and thumbnail in the first place.

238
00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:26.815
Um, la I still, I'll I see your question.

239
00:10:26.815 --> 00:10:27.935
I'll get to that in a sec.

240
00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:29.415
So you need to have a title and

241
00:10:29.415 --> 00:10:30.255
thumbnail set in the first place.

242
00:10:30.475 --> 00:10:33.495
And this is by design.

243
00:10:34.075 --> 00:10:35.935
And I don't know if this is a hot take,

244
00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:38.175
but this is where I personally stand and what I've seen.

245
00:10:38.755 --> 00:10:41.055
So many people have improved their intros

246
00:10:41.055 --> 00:10:42.415
and by default, their retention, their videos

247
00:10:42.995 --> 00:10:44.495
is working on the title

248
00:10:44.555 --> 00:10:46.815
and thumbnail First, if you don't have a good title

249
00:10:46.815 --> 00:10:48.135
and thumbnail set to begin with,

250
00:10:48.835 --> 00:10:50.735
you shouldn't be working on your intro yet,

251
00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:52.855
and I'll explain why.

252
00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:55.815
So on YouTube, having a killer title

253
00:10:55.815 --> 00:10:58.855
and thumbnail, having a clickable packaging is

254
00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.215
so incredibly important in order to get clicks.

255
00:11:01.215 --> 00:11:02.815
If people don't click, people won't watch.

256
00:11:03.715 --> 00:11:07.375
And what I often see is people will have an idea for a video

257
00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:10.895
and then start off as most people do, by writing the intro

258
00:11:10.895 --> 00:11:11.935
and writing the rest of their script.

259
00:11:12.395 --> 00:11:15.695
But in doing so, you, your packaging, your title

260
00:11:15.695 --> 00:11:17.815
and thumbnail is then locked in

261
00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:21.255
to whatever angle you've already written into your intro.

262
00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:23.935
Instead of what you should do is think about

263
00:11:23.935 --> 00:11:26.455
what is the most clickable title and thumbnail I can make.

264
00:11:26.505 --> 00:11:29.375
First draft up that title and thumbnail

265
00:11:29.595 --> 00:11:31.975
and then use that to write your intro,

266
00:11:32.445 --> 00:11:36.095
because again, that's how, that's for better or for worse.

267
00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.455
YouTube is a game of clicks,

268
00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:39.935
especially on long term YouTube, long form YouTube,

269
00:11:40.275 --> 00:11:42.695
and you can only get that click if you focus on the title

270
00:11:42.695 --> 00:11:44.335
and thumbnail in the first place.

271
00:11:45.155 --> 00:11:48.095
Um, I'll get to your question now, which is,

272
00:11:48.095 --> 00:11:49.215
how does this play into the new theory

273
00:11:49.215 --> 00:11:51.055
of having shock hook slash counter hooks?

274
00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:55.955
It's, I will say that

275
00:11:56.525 --> 00:11:59.075
again, there are different ways to make an intro.

276
00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:03.795
This is the formula that I've seen is the most consistent in

277
00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:06.035
keeping retention up throughout a wide

278
00:12:06.045 --> 00:12:07.315
range of different videos.

279
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:10.115
There are for sure other types of videos

280
00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.715
and other types of intro, like there are

281
00:12:12.795 --> 00:12:14.115
for sure other types of intros,

282
00:12:14.255 --> 00:12:16.715
but those tend to be easier to get wrong.

283
00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:20.075
I think in general, what I recommend is like learning the

284
00:12:20.075 --> 00:12:22.715
formula first and then afterwards you can

285
00:12:23.415 --> 00:12:24.515
try out different things.

286
00:12:25.055 --> 00:12:27.835
But for the most part, even with like a counter hook,

287
00:12:27.835 --> 00:12:32.155
you don't wanna, like subverting expectations exists

288
00:12:32.615 --> 00:12:35.475
as long as you imply that those expectations are there

289
00:12:35.475 --> 00:12:36.675
to begin with, right?

290
00:12:36.675 --> 00:12:39.395
Because if you start, let's say a video about bullet

291
00:12:39.395 --> 00:12:42.675
journaling and you start off by saying, you know,

292
00:12:42.675 --> 00:12:46.685
something like, yeah, like, uh, you know,

293
00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:48.205
if you start off by saying,

294
00:12:48.475 --> 00:12:50.965
I've never been good at journaling, great

295
00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:53.245
that subverts expectations in a way,

296
00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:55.845
but still, del still delivers on that promise,

297
00:12:55.945 --> 00:12:57.485
you still know what you're going to be talking about.

298
00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.805
Versus you start by saying, so today I decided

299
00:13:00.805 --> 00:13:01.885
to go out and grab some coffee.

300
00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.125
It's like people will jump in

301
00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:05.725
and be like, this, this isn't what I clicked on,

302
00:13:05.725 --> 00:13:06.765
this isn't what I expected.

303
00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:09.125
And will then click off. Hopefully

304
00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.325
that answers your question.

305
00:13:10.345 --> 00:13:12.525
And yeah, feel free to just ask more questions

306
00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:14.205
as we go along as well.

307
00:13:14.635 --> 00:13:16.965
I'll have time for questions at the end of course,

308
00:13:17.265 --> 00:13:20.245
but yeah, absolutely love to answer those as we go through.

309
00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:26.105
So with all that being said, let's write

310
00:13:26.845 --> 00:13:29.305
the first sentence of our intro.

311
00:13:29.525 --> 00:13:31.625
Yes, we are doing this and we are doing this together.

312
00:13:32.565 --> 00:13:36.865
And to make things simple, I'm going to assign you a title

313
00:13:36.885 --> 00:13:40.065
and thumbnail to go off of, just so you don't have

314
00:13:40.065 --> 00:13:41.945
to come up with quite so many things in this moment.

315
00:13:41.945 --> 00:13:43.145
You don't have to come up with like a title

316
00:13:43.145 --> 00:13:45.225
and thumbnail off the top of your head.

317
00:13:45.565 --> 00:13:47.825
And again, once you write this intro once

318
00:13:47.825 --> 00:13:50.705
and understand the formula, you'll be able to apply it

319
00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:52.705
to any format in the future that you want.

320
00:13:53.095 --> 00:13:55.185
That being, that being said, if you do have a title

321
00:13:55.185 --> 00:13:57.065
and thumbnail of your own that you wanna work off of,

322
00:13:57.335 --> 00:13:58.905
that is completely fine.

323
00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.105
100%, absolutely. Go for it.

324
00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:02.585
Um, or if you have like a title

325
00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:04.145
and thumbnail in the past that you've done

326
00:14:04.145 --> 00:14:06.825
that you wanna write an intro for, go for it as well.

327
00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:10.385
Uh, but the example that I'll be walking through

328
00:14:10.405 --> 00:14:13.705
and I invite you to work off of if you would like, is this,

329
00:14:14.075 --> 00:14:18.345
which is, I walked 30,000 steps a day for 30 days.

330
00:14:18.885 --> 00:14:20.545
Now this concept was taken from up

331
00:14:20.545 --> 00:14:22.145
and coming creator Macari Espy,

332
00:14:22.145 --> 00:14:24.905
who has absolutely been crushing it on YouTube,

333
00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:27.705
and you should all definitely go check out her content on

334
00:14:27.705 --> 00:14:30.265
YouTube if you haven't already, it's a banger.

335
00:14:30.805 --> 00:14:34.465
Um, and we're going to write the first sentence of the intro

336
00:14:34.525 --> 00:14:38.735
for this video, and I'm gonna give you 90 seconds

337
00:14:38.955 --> 00:14:41.935
to write the first sentence, which is luxury, 90 seconds

338
00:14:42.075 --> 00:14:45.815
for a single 90 seconds for a single sentence luxury.

339
00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:47.735
And as you go ahead

340
00:14:47.735 --> 00:14:49.535
and write the sentence, keep in mind

341
00:14:50.395 --> 00:14:52.955
how can you meet the expectations set

342
00:14:53.015 --> 00:14:54.315
by the title and thumbnail.

343
00:14:54.315 --> 00:14:56.075
If you look at this packaging, look at this title

344
00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.315
and look at the thumbnail.

345
00:14:58.145 --> 00:14:59.155
What are you expecting

346
00:14:59.155 --> 00:15:00.875
and how can you meet those expectations

347
00:15:01.535 --> 00:15:02.755
in the first sentence

348
00:15:03.505 --> 00:15:05.845
before we get into the 90 seconds, any

349
00:15:06.525 --> 00:15:09.005
questions about what's being asked of you?

350
00:15:09.005 --> 00:15:10.005
And what we're going to do,

351
00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:19.095
I'll hold, I'll hold, wait

352
00:15:19.095 --> 00:15:20.295
to see if people have questions.

353
00:15:21.665 --> 00:15:24.525
Um, we're good. Okay, great.

354
00:15:24.665 --> 00:15:27.045
I'm like, okay, either people are asleep

355
00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:29.885
or I'm a great teacher, so I'm gonna assume the latter

356
00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:32.045
and we're gonna go for it.

357
00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:34.245
So I will see you all in 30 seconds.

358
00:15:34.245 --> 00:15:36.685
There's gonna be a little chime when we have

359
00:15:36.785 --> 00:15:37.965
30 seconds left.

360
00:15:38.505 --> 00:15:39.925
Um, and go for it.

361
00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:51.165
Uh, you can go ahead

362
00:15:51.165 --> 00:15:53.845
and type in there absolutely, if you would like to.

363
00:17:11.115 --> 00:17:12.855
All right, welcome back.

364
00:17:12.925 --> 00:17:14.855
Hopefully people have had enough time

365
00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:17.735
to write their sentence and I see some people already in the

366
00:17:17.735 --> 00:17:19.935
chat, uh, putting their sentences in, which I love.

367
00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:21.535
If you're feeling brave, go ahead

368
00:17:21.535 --> 00:17:23.575
and put your, your first sentence in the chat.

369
00:17:23.635 --> 00:17:25.655
If you're working off of a different title

370
00:17:25.715 --> 00:17:28.575
or thumbnail, just drop the title that you're working off of

371
00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:29.655
and then your first sentence.

372
00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:32.455
Um, but let's take a look at what we've got.

373
00:17:33.155 --> 00:17:37.455
So first up, I see Lionel saying, I never thought

374
00:17:37.455 --> 00:17:40.015
that walking 30,000 steps a day would not only change my

375
00:17:40.015 --> 00:17:41.575
health, but change my happiness too.

376
00:17:42.315 --> 00:17:46.855
So I like the first part of that.

377
00:17:47.355 --> 00:17:51.245
My feedback there would be change my health,

378
00:17:51.385 --> 00:17:55.165
but change my happiness too is just a little bit vague.

379
00:17:56.125 --> 00:18:00.455
I think that for your first sentence, you want to be more

380
00:18:01.215 --> 00:18:03.935
concrete so people know what they're going to expect.

381
00:18:04.315 --> 00:18:06.495
So like, change my health, change my happiness.

382
00:18:06.495 --> 00:18:08.695
Like what does that really mean?

383
00:18:09.055 --> 00:18:11.215
I would just be a little bit more concrete there.

384
00:18:11.915 --> 00:18:15.695
Um, so you also tried going from walking one K

385
00:18:15.715 --> 00:18:18.335
to 30 KI would say steps per day

386
00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:22.175
in there seemed impossible until I tried this one thing.

387
00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:25.615
I I do, I do like that,

388
00:18:25.615 --> 00:18:27.415
that gets into the point really quickly.

389
00:18:27.735 --> 00:18:30.415
I see that being a different type of video, so like less

390
00:18:30.415 --> 00:18:31.415
so like a challenge more

391
00:18:31.415 --> 00:18:33.295
so maybe like an educational video there.

392
00:18:34.015 --> 00:18:36.695
I think that could work as a first sentence. Absolutely.

393
00:18:37.195 --> 00:18:41.775
Um, I see Darren's, I walked 30,000 steps a day for 30 days

394
00:18:41.915 --> 00:18:43.495
and lost 10 pounds remarkably.

395
00:18:44.035 --> 00:18:46.895
So the thing with the first sentence as well,

396
00:18:47.005 --> 00:18:51.255
what I'm seeing here is that you are teasing the payoff

397
00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:52.735
or like you're giving them the payoff.

398
00:18:53.515 --> 00:18:57.915
I would say far too early, the the, when I say payoff,

399
00:18:58.305 --> 00:19:00.915
there's this concept called like set up tension payoff,

400
00:19:00.915 --> 00:19:03.595
where you want to set up something that happens

401
00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:06.075
and then have tension building

402
00:19:06.255 --> 00:19:08.435
and then you pay off what it is that happens.

403
00:19:08.975 --> 00:19:10.075
Losing 10 pounds

404
00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:12.075
after a challenge like this would be

405
00:19:12.595 --> 00:19:13.955
a pretty remarkable payoff.

406
00:19:13.955 --> 00:19:15.435
That's amazing. So

407
00:19:15.545 --> 00:19:18.435
what I would do is I wouldn't exactly list what that is yet.

408
00:19:19.015 --> 00:19:22.435
Um, but I would say maybe something along along the lines

409
00:19:22.435 --> 00:19:25.995
of like, I walked 30 steps a day for 30 days

410
00:19:26.975 --> 00:19:30.795
and uh, you know, like I I, I walked thir

411
00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:34.755
30,000 steps a day for 30 days to see what it would do

412
00:19:34.755 --> 00:19:35.795
to my body, right?

413
00:19:35.795 --> 00:19:38.555
And so then you kind of set up the promise of this is

414
00:19:38.555 --> 00:19:41.475
what you did, meet the expectations set by, by your titles

415
00:19:41.475 --> 00:19:45.235
and thumbnails and then also set up starting the reason why,

416
00:19:45.305 --> 00:19:47.475
like what is going to happen because of that.

417
00:19:48.255 --> 00:19:51.235
Um, I'll go through one more, which is

418
00:19:51.785 --> 00:19:53.555
walking 30,000 steps a day was

419
00:19:53.555 --> 00:19:54.755
so much harder than I thought.

420
00:20:00.995 --> 00:20:05.925
Hmm. I think like with, with that one,

421
00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:10.925
what I would say is we're not quite getting

422
00:20:11.245 --> 00:20:12.525
a clear enough reason to click,

423
00:20:12.525 --> 00:20:15.605
and we're going to get into reasons to click like,

424
00:20:15.605 --> 00:20:18.485
not like reasons to keep watching in the next section

425
00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:19.645
after the first sentence.

426
00:20:20.025 --> 00:20:24.045
But when I see this, again, the con the concept of promise

427
00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:26.085
or like set up tension

428
00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:30.005
and payoff, the was so much harder than I thought.

429
00:20:30.585 --> 00:20:33.045
For you, that's like a clear reason to keep watching, right?

430
00:20:33.045 --> 00:20:34.885
You like wanna see what your own emotional

431
00:20:34.955 --> 00:20:36.725
turmoil was during this time.

432
00:20:37.065 --> 00:20:39.485
But for a random viewer, you have to think of everything

433
00:20:39.485 --> 00:20:42.045
through the lens of like, what did this person has no

434
00:20:42.045 --> 00:20:44.245
context into who you are, what you do,

435
00:20:44.245 --> 00:20:45.845
what your journey is, or anything else like that.

436
00:20:46.475 --> 00:20:48.005
They could see a sentence like that

437
00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:51.165
and think, oh, like this video is just going

438
00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:53.285
to talk about like, you know, their,

439
00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.125
their own personal struggles,

440
00:20:55.175 --> 00:20:57.085
which might not be a compelling enough

441
00:20:57.085 --> 00:20:58.205
reason for them to watch.

442
00:20:58.825 --> 00:21:01.245
So I think in that case, maybe a way

443
00:21:01.245 --> 00:21:04.165
that I would rephrase it would be something along the lines

444
00:21:04.265 --> 00:21:08.705
of, um, you know, like I walked,

445
00:21:09.065 --> 00:21:12.985
I walked 30,000 steps a day for 30 days

446
00:21:14.185 --> 00:21:17.445
to see if and then have a reason.

447
00:21:17.705 --> 00:21:19.965
And then after that say like, it was

448
00:21:19.965 --> 00:21:21.125
so much harder than I thought.

449
00:21:21.385 --> 00:21:23.325
And then kind of continue with the rest of the intro.

450
00:21:23.745 --> 00:21:26.565
But we'll get into that more in the next section.

451
00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:30.805
Um, but great job so far, guys.

452
00:21:30.945 --> 00:21:34.885
Um, I love that we like are immediately like the, the

453
00:21:34.885 --> 00:21:38.245
through line here is having the words like the main action

454
00:21:38.245 --> 00:21:40.205
words of the title into the intro.

455
00:21:40.825 --> 00:21:42.685
Um, great,

456
00:21:44.225 --> 00:21:46.375
let's, I'm gonna show you mine.

457
00:21:46.955 --> 00:21:51.455
So this was my example, which is this is a step

458
00:21:51.555 --> 00:21:54.055
and over the next 30 days I'll be doing 30,000

459
00:21:54.055 --> 00:21:55.175
of them per day.

460
00:21:55.955 --> 00:21:59.635
So what do we have here? Well, we have a mention of 30 days.

461
00:21:59.655 --> 00:22:00.995
We have a mention of 30,000 steps.

462
00:22:01.615 --> 00:22:04.435
So any viewer who is interested enough in the title

463
00:22:04.435 --> 00:22:06.995
and thumbnail to click on this video is now satisfied

464
00:22:06.995 --> 00:22:08.275
knowing that they're going to get

465
00:22:08.275 --> 00:22:09.435
exactly what they came for.

466
00:22:10.215 --> 00:22:13.195
Um, it's pretty straightforward, pretty simple,

467
00:22:13.575 --> 00:22:14.675
and it's all out there.

468
00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:18.835
Now in one sentence, you shouldn't have had too much room

469
00:22:18.835 --> 00:22:22.155
to get into too much trouble yet with this other problem

470
00:22:22.465 --> 00:22:25.435
that typically happens in intros, which is that we tend

471
00:22:25.435 --> 00:22:27.475
to try to do too much in an intro.

472
00:22:27.475 --> 00:22:29.595
We try, we tend to try to put, we tend to try

473
00:22:29.595 --> 00:22:32.115
to put too much in intros when it comes

474
00:22:32.175 --> 00:22:34.075
to the length of your intro.

475
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:38.475
While it does vary from YouTube to YouTuber,

476
00:22:38.655 --> 00:22:41.475
you typically wanna keep it between 20

477
00:22:41.815 --> 00:22:43.995
to 40 seconds long, maximum.

478
00:22:45.125 --> 00:22:49.155
Often the shorter on that spectrum, your intro is the better

479
00:22:49.155 --> 00:22:52.875
because you know, TikTok attention spans baby.

480
00:22:53.025 --> 00:22:54.635
Like people are impatient

481
00:22:54.855 --> 00:22:57.435
and they want to get, they want the v the video to start

482
00:22:57.455 --> 00:22:59.435
as soon as possible.

483
00:23:00.215 --> 00:23:03.635
And usually this 20 to 40, uh,

484
00:23:03.775 --> 00:23:06.675
second time constraint translates to around five

485
00:23:06.695 --> 00:23:09.075
to seven sentences long for an intro.

486
00:23:09.775 --> 00:23:11.955
And good news is we've already written

487
00:23:12.095 --> 00:23:13.395
one sentence together.

488
00:23:13.885 --> 00:23:16.475
Great. Now let's move on to the rest of the intro.

489
00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:20.475
In the remaining four to six sentences that we have left,

490
00:23:20.885 --> 00:23:22.555
we're going to need to do three things.

491
00:23:23.525 --> 00:23:27.195
We're going to provide context, we're going to create one

492
00:23:27.195 --> 00:23:28.435
or more curiosity gaps,

493
00:23:28.895 --> 00:23:31.595
and we're going to leverage something called input bias,

494
00:23:31.595 --> 00:23:33.755
which is one of my favorite things to do in an intro.

495
00:23:34.285 --> 00:23:37.995
We'll get there, but for now we're gonna start with context.

496
00:23:39.605 --> 00:23:44.585
So your context establishes the what and sometimes the why.

497
00:23:45.225 --> 00:23:49.085
So what is it that you're doing and why are you doing it?

498
00:23:49.185 --> 00:23:53.925
Why does it matter? And this why shouldn't be this super

499
00:23:54.275 --> 00:23:55.965
long drawn out story.

500
00:23:56.105 --> 00:23:58.245
In many videos there's often this like deeper,

501
00:23:58.795 --> 00:24:02.285
more maybe like emotional why behind what you're doing.

502
00:24:03.105 --> 00:24:05.085
And that is called the desire.

503
00:24:05.305 --> 00:24:07.445
And the desire is a segment that actually comes

504
00:24:07.775 --> 00:24:08.965
after the intro.

505
00:24:10.185 --> 00:24:11.525
The whole point of the intro

506
00:24:11.525 --> 00:24:13.085
and the whole point of what you're doing here

507
00:24:13.085 --> 00:24:16.125
with this context is give them

508
00:24:17.995 --> 00:24:20.325
just enough so that they're not confused

509
00:24:20.545 --> 00:24:21.845
and so that they care.

510
00:24:22.465 --> 00:24:24.925
And as a little as possible that you need

511
00:24:24.925 --> 00:24:27.125
to provide them in order to get those two things across.

512
00:24:28.185 --> 00:24:31.165
And also, if the what is interesting enough,

513
00:24:31.785 --> 00:24:34.085
you often won't even need the why in your intro

514
00:24:34.085 --> 00:24:36.445
because if you were already has enough

515
00:24:36.465 --> 00:24:37.605
to be invested, right?

516
00:24:37.605 --> 00:24:40.365
Like as they say, there's no boring way to tell someone

517
00:24:40.365 --> 00:24:41.565
that you won the lottery.

518
00:24:41.905 --> 00:24:43.165
If you're what is interesting enough,

519
00:24:43.185 --> 00:24:44.445
you don't need this extra why.

520
00:24:44.865 --> 00:24:47.125
Um, you only want to include the context necessary

521
00:24:47.345 --> 00:24:49.005
to get the viewer to care.

522
00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:51.805
So that is context.

523
00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:56.445
And as we go through these things, uh, keep in mind

524
00:24:57.695 --> 00:25:00.595
how you think you would apply this to the intro

525
00:25:00.595 --> 00:25:01.595
that we are writing.

526
00:25:02.855 --> 00:25:05.955
So that's context. Let's take a look at

527
00:25:06.095 --> 00:25:07.235
an example of context.

528
00:25:07.855 --> 00:25:11.875
So this is a video from the lovely Mark Rober,

529
00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:14.555
the title being This Ball is Impossible to hit.

530
00:25:14.925 --> 00:25:18.275
First Things First, let's take a look at his first sentence.

531
00:25:19.475 --> 00:25:22.455
Th this is me pitching a ball that's impossible

532
00:25:22.455 --> 00:25:23.895
to hit and I engineered,

533
00:25:24.885 --> 00:25:28.385
All right, first sentence was, this is me pitching a ball

534
00:25:28.385 --> 00:25:29.505
that's impossible to hit.

535
00:25:29.955 --> 00:25:33.265
Great immediately delivers on the expectations set

536
00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:34.305
by the title and thumbnail.

537
00:25:34.655 --> 00:25:36.425
Very clear. If someone clicked on this video,

538
00:25:37.095 --> 00:25:38.345
hear that first sentence.

539
00:25:38.405 --> 00:25:41.025
So he'd be like, yes, this is exactly what it came for.

540
00:25:41.325 --> 00:25:42.425
It was not click bait.

541
00:25:42.495 --> 00:25:44.145
This is a ball that's impossible to hit.

542
00:25:44.675 --> 00:25:48.705
First five seconds done. Next Marx moves into the context.

543
00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:51.625
So he establishes the what and he establishes the why.

544
00:25:52.845 --> 00:25:53.845
Take a look

545
00:25:55.135 --> 00:25:56.135
Hit. And I engineered

546
00:25:56.135 --> 00:25:57.115
it out of necessity

547
00:25:57.315 --> 00:25:58.995
because I'm facing off against the

548
00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:00.515
world's greatest Wiffle ball players.

549
00:26:00.655 --> 00:26:02.875
Now, wiffle Ball is the popular backyard version

550
00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:04.315
of baseball here in America.

551
00:26:04.545 --> 00:26:05.545
What?

552
00:26:06.195 --> 00:26:07.485
Okay, that's the context.

553
00:26:08.265 --> 00:26:12.205
So in just a few sentences, mark has established the why

554
00:26:12.465 --> 00:26:15.565
behind why he created a ball that's impossible to hit,

555
00:26:15.695 --> 00:26:17.525
which is to face off against the

556
00:26:17.525 --> 00:26:18.845
world's greatest whiffle ball players.

557
00:26:19.465 --> 00:26:21.565
And he's established the necessary context of

558
00:26:21.595 --> 00:26:22.605
what Whiffle ball is.

559
00:26:22.605 --> 00:26:24.565
For those of us who have no idea, I dunno about you,

560
00:26:24.725 --> 00:26:27.325
I have never heard about whiffle ball before this video.

561
00:26:27.785 --> 00:26:31.845
So it's like, okay, we have the, the, the why he did it,

562
00:26:31.985 --> 00:26:35.325
and we have the what in terms of necessary context

563
00:26:35.505 --> 00:26:36.645
of what the thing is.

564
00:26:37.185 --> 00:26:40.205
You have a football nice I've never played before.

565
00:26:40.585 --> 00:26:41.885
Um, it is being recorded.

566
00:26:42.665 --> 00:26:45.325
So that's context, uh,

567
00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:48.215
context, woo.

568
00:26:48.755 --> 00:26:51.215
The next thing your intro has to do is open one

569
00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:52.495
or more curiosity gaps.

570
00:26:53.115 --> 00:26:55.855
Now a curiosity gap is the gap between

571
00:26:56.005 --> 00:26:58.255
what we currently know and what we want to know.

572
00:26:58.715 --> 00:27:01.055
And it's one of the most basic drivers of human behavior

573
00:27:01.565 --> 00:27:04.855
because as humans, our brains are wired to create closure.

574
00:27:05.435 --> 00:27:07.975
So if we're introduced to an unfinished story

575
00:27:08.115 --> 00:27:10.975
or a question without an answer, it feels like an itch

576
00:27:10.975 --> 00:27:13.295
that we very, very, very much want to scratch.

577
00:27:13.675 --> 00:27:14.855
And our brains go, wow,

578
00:27:15.255 --> 00:27:16.655
I could really use some closure right now.

579
00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:18.935
And it prompts us to stick around long enough

580
00:27:19.035 --> 00:27:20.895
to get the answer.

581
00:27:22.355 --> 00:27:26.455
So when I talked earlier about not wanting the payoff

582
00:27:26.595 --> 00:27:29.855
to come too early, this is what we're talking about here.

583
00:27:30.155 --> 00:27:33.055
You want to tease a payoff, you want to open a loop,

584
00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:35.135
but not close the loop in the beginning.

585
00:27:35.335 --> 00:27:37.895
'cause you want people to watch the video in order to

586
00:27:38.675 --> 00:27:39.735
end the loop in order

587
00:27:39.815 --> 00:27:41.415
to close the loop in order to get the answer.

588
00:27:42.075 --> 00:27:45.175
So let's return back to Mark's intro to see

589
00:27:45.675 --> 00:27:47.735
how he creates curiosity gaps.

590
00:27:49.865 --> 00:27:52.815
Erica, what makes it really interesting is the balls have

591
00:27:52.815 --> 00:27:54.375
these holes on one side,

592
00:27:54.425 --> 00:27:56.895
which means they can curve like crazy,

593
00:27:59.795 --> 00:28:00.815
but how does that work?

594
00:28:00.915 --> 00:28:02.175
And how do baseballs

595
00:28:02.275 --> 00:28:04.895
or really balls from any sport actually curve

596
00:28:04.895 --> 00:28:06.215
through the air for that matter?

597
00:28:06.395 --> 00:28:08.095
So today we're gonna test our way

598
00:28:08.155 --> 00:28:09.575
to find an answer to that question.

599
00:28:09.635 --> 00:28:11.295
And since I grew up playing countless hours

600
00:28:11.295 --> 00:28:14.095
of whle ball myself, I'm gonna revive a lifelong dream

601
00:28:14.095 --> 00:28:16.535
of going head to head against the pros and I,

602
00:28:18.255 --> 00:28:19.915
All right, that's the context.

603
00:28:20.895 --> 00:28:25.365
So in just a few, uh, that's a, the,

604
00:28:25.505 --> 00:28:26.805
the, the curiosity gap.

605
00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:30.485
So in just a few sentences, mark has opened not one,

606
00:28:30.785 --> 00:28:33.525
but two different curiosity gaps.

607
00:28:34.025 --> 00:28:37.685
The first one is, why do balls curve through the air?

608
00:28:38.265 --> 00:28:40.445
Um, and Mark actually does so very explicitly

609
00:28:40.465 --> 00:28:42.685
by even asking, but how does that work?

610
00:28:43.225 --> 00:28:44.885
And he is talking both about, you know,

611
00:28:44.995 --> 00:28:46.365
what makes wiffle balls work,

612
00:28:46.365 --> 00:28:49.365
but also how do any other balls curve through the air.

613
00:28:49.625 --> 00:28:52.645
So that's the first curiosity gap that Mark opens.

614
00:28:52.855 --> 00:28:54.045
We're going to figure out

615
00:28:54.045 --> 00:28:55.805
through the video how they do that.

616
00:28:56.355 --> 00:28:57.565
It's an unfinished question,

617
00:28:58.545 --> 00:29:01.645
but there's another curiosity gap that Mark opens here.

618
00:29:02.225 --> 00:29:05.375
And I pose a question to you guys.

619
00:29:06.155 --> 00:29:08.815
Do you know what the second curiosity gap is?

620
00:29:08.915 --> 00:29:10.255
Do you have any guesses for

621
00:29:10.255 --> 00:29:13.095
what the second curiosity gap is within

622
00:29:13.275 --> 00:29:14.335
the section of the intro?

623
00:29:15.615 --> 00:29:16.755
Can you identify it?

624
00:29:28.435 --> 00:29:30.795
Ultimately, how did he do, did anyone get a hit?

625
00:29:32.085 --> 00:29:34.465
And I see pros. Yeah, absolutely.

626
00:29:34.725 --> 00:29:36.745
Um, a hundred percent you guys are spot on.

627
00:29:37.015 --> 00:29:41.145
It's this last piece here, which is this,

628
00:29:42.355 --> 00:29:46.235
uh, will mark win against the whiffle ball pros?

629
00:29:46.815 --> 00:29:49.275
How does he do like he's going head to head against them.

630
00:29:49.945 --> 00:29:52.795
What happens next? What is the result?

631
00:29:53.295 --> 00:29:55.075
So those are the two curiosity gaps

632
00:29:55.075 --> 00:29:56.315
that are open within this intro.

633
00:29:56.815 --> 00:29:57.915
And you don't need

634
00:29:57.915 --> 00:30:00.675
to open two different curiosity gaps within your own intro,

635
00:30:00.855 --> 00:30:04.355
but opening just one solid loop gives viewers a reason

636
00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:06.275
to stick around and will help your retention,

637
00:30:06.575 --> 00:30:08.155
not just in your first 30 seconds,

638
00:30:08.575 --> 00:30:11.115
but throughout the rest of your entire video

639
00:30:11.415 --> 00:30:14.235
as they continue watching to see what happens.

640
00:30:15.295 --> 00:30:19.875
So those are curiosity gaps I see. Makes sense. Amazing.

641
00:30:21.175 --> 00:30:25.635
So in his intro so far, mark has met the expectations set

642
00:30:25.635 --> 00:30:26.675
by the title and thumbnail.

643
00:30:26.675 --> 00:30:27.675
This very first sentence,

644
00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:31.195
he's established context into why he was creating this ball

645
00:30:31.335 --> 00:30:33.395
and what Wiffle Ball is in the first place.

646
00:30:33.775 --> 00:30:37.035
And he is opened to curiosity gaps, both in terms

647
00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:39.235
of why do balls curve through the air

648
00:30:39.815 --> 00:30:42.915
and will mark win against these

649
00:30:42.915 --> 00:30:44.355
professional whiff football players.

650
00:30:45.065 --> 00:30:46.435
He's already done a lot in intro,

651
00:30:47.015 --> 00:30:50.035
but the best YouTube intros don't just meet the

652
00:30:50.035 --> 00:30:51.355
expectations set by the title and thumbnail.

653
00:30:51.705 --> 00:30:53.795
They exceed those expectations.

654
00:30:55.045 --> 00:30:59.475
Which brings us to the last element of the intro input bias.

655
00:30:59.885 --> 00:31:04.635
Again, I love incorporating input bias into YouTube intros

656
00:31:04.635 --> 00:31:06.115
and I will show you what I mean.

657
00:31:06.835 --> 00:31:08.575
So input bias is the idea

658
00:31:08.575 --> 00:31:10.615
that the more effort we put into something, whether

659
00:31:10.615 --> 00:31:14.615
that be time or energy or money, time, money

660
00:31:14.655 --> 00:31:16.935
or energy, the more that we'll value it.

661
00:31:17.715 --> 00:31:20.895
And as an example of input bias, one

662
00:31:20.895 --> 00:31:22.655
that you may have even experienced in your own life,

663
00:31:23.795 --> 00:31:27.855
if we pay, let's say $50 for a bottle of wine, we're going

664
00:31:27.855 --> 00:31:30.455
to value that more than if we pay $20 for

665
00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:33.975
that exact same bottle of wine, it is the same bottle

666
00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:37.775
of wine, but just from the act of paying more for it,

667
00:31:37.825 --> 00:31:40.095
we'll sip it and be like, hmm, this tastes better.

668
00:31:40.955 --> 00:31:43.895
Uh, and it's this truly wacky thing

669
00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:45.615
that exists in human psychology.

670
00:31:46.075 --> 00:31:48.095
But the good news is, is that we can leverage

671
00:31:48.325 --> 00:31:51.615
that within our own YouTube videos to get people

672
00:31:51.755 --> 00:31:54.055
to care about our videos more, to get people

673
00:31:54.115 --> 00:31:55.735
to value our videos more.

674
00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:58.495
So let's take a look at

675
00:31:58.515 --> 00:32:02.575
how Mark leverages input bias in the rest of his intro here.

676
00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:05.935
And, and I don't wanna give too much away,

677
00:32:06.035 --> 00:32:08.175
but I might have had to rely on my engineering skills

678
00:32:10.075 --> 00:32:11.215
to level the playing field.

679
00:32:19.295 --> 00:32:20.895
I love that at the end where it gets hit

680
00:32:21.395 --> 00:32:22.735
by the base plates.

681
00:32:23.435 --> 00:32:26.255
Uh, so this is how Mark not only meets the expectation

682
00:32:26.405 --> 00:32:28.775
that the, like he's going to create a ball that's impossible

683
00:32:28.775 --> 00:32:31.855
to hit, but it's going to exceed that expectation by showing

684
00:32:32.195 --> 00:32:34.535
how much work went into the creation of the ball,

685
00:32:34.565 --> 00:32:36.255
showing himself, making the ball,

686
00:32:36.635 --> 00:32:39.365
and also having the implication that there's going

687
00:32:39.365 --> 00:32:42.765
to be even more engineering related tricks up his sleeve

688
00:32:43.265 --> 00:32:45.165
by showing, again, that face plate moving,

689
00:32:45.165 --> 00:32:46.405
showing that there's going to be more.

690
00:32:46.865 --> 00:32:49.885
And as a result, you as a viewer value the video more

691
00:32:50.075 --> 00:32:52.485
because you're like, oh, like one,

692
00:32:52.945 --> 00:32:54.965
he actually did the thing that's really cool.

693
00:32:54.965 --> 00:32:56.005
He put so much effort into this.

694
00:32:56.025 --> 00:32:58.285
And two, I'm not just going

695
00:32:58.285 --> 00:33:00.325
to get the ball that's impossible to hit.

696
00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:03.085
I'm gonna get all of these other really cool tricks

697
00:33:03.085 --> 00:33:04.725
that he's going to show me within this video.

698
00:33:05.265 --> 00:33:07.325
And as a result, you value the video more

699
00:33:07.325 --> 00:33:09.165
and you're more likely to continue watching.

700
00:33:09.785 --> 00:33:14.005
Now you don't need to be an engineering superhero in order

701
00:33:14.005 --> 00:33:15.085
to leverage input bias.

702
00:33:15.205 --> 00:33:17.485
I think that's a misconception that I see a lot is a lot

703
00:33:17.485 --> 00:33:19.325
of people think like, oh, like I need

704
00:33:19.325 --> 00:33:20.965
to have a million dollars, or I need to be able

705
00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:23.845
to do these like crazy spectacular things in order

706
00:33:23.985 --> 00:33:25.485
to leverage input bias.

707
00:33:26.185 --> 00:33:29.675
Um, and the question

708
00:33:29.675 --> 00:33:31.395
of does it mean I would be good

709
00:33:31.395 --> 00:33:32.635
to use clips of the behind the scenes?

710
00:33:33.065 --> 00:33:34.955
Yeah, I mean, what hundred percent?

711
00:33:35.535 --> 00:33:38.075
So for instance, other ways

712
00:33:38.075 --> 00:33:39.355
that you could leverage input bias.

713
00:33:40.045 --> 00:33:41.235
Let's say you're working on a video.

714
00:33:41.415 --> 00:33:45.115
If you, if you mention you spent seven days researching for

715
00:33:45.115 --> 00:33:47.155
that video, that's a little teaser,

716
00:33:47.335 --> 00:33:48.675
you could call it behind the scenes.

717
00:33:48.975 --> 00:33:50.355
But it's showing how much effort

718
00:33:50.355 --> 00:33:51.395
you put into, into the video.

719
00:33:51.395 --> 00:33:54.595
People be like, oh wow, she put seven days

720
00:33:54.895 --> 00:33:56.995
of research into this, I'm going to wanna watch it.

721
00:33:57.415 --> 00:33:59.995
Um, maybe you, you're making a video essay

722
00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:04.475
and you show a clip of yourself interviewing an expert.

723
00:34:04.545 --> 00:34:06.275
Like it shows that you went extra step beyond.

724
00:34:06.345 --> 00:34:08.995
Most people just research things that, that they find,

725
00:34:09.055 --> 00:34:11.235
but you took the extra step to actually reach out

726
00:34:11.235 --> 00:34:12.675
to experts to talk to 'em about things.

727
00:34:13.165 --> 00:34:16.475
Maybe it's traveling to a cool place that, uh,

728
00:34:16.535 --> 00:34:17.715
you know, most people won't do.

729
00:34:17.815 --> 00:34:19.195
Or just like anything else

730
00:34:19.265 --> 00:34:21.115
that few others would be willing to do.

731
00:34:21.575 --> 00:34:24.915
By showing that little extra sauce, people are going

732
00:34:24.915 --> 00:34:26.395
to value a video more and thus will

733
00:34:26.395 --> 00:34:27.515
be more willing to keep watching.

734
00:34:28.255 --> 00:34:30.715
And the cool thing about info bias is

735
00:34:30.715 --> 00:34:32.635
that it doesn't even need

736
00:34:32.635 --> 00:34:35.235
to be mentioned verbally in the video itself.

737
00:34:35.575 --> 00:34:38.675
Simply by, let's say like incorporating a high level

738
00:34:38.675 --> 00:34:40.635
of editing could count as input bias

739
00:34:41.215 --> 00:34:43.395
or having more cinematic shots

740
00:34:43.495 --> 00:34:44.755
or just like higher production value.

741
00:34:45.095 --> 00:34:48.795
All of those things implicitly signal to the video, signal

742
00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:50.995
to the viewer that the video is worth watching.

743
00:34:51.935 --> 00:34:54.835
Um, hoping to interview style content. Thank you for that.

744
00:34:54.835 --> 00:34:58.155
Yeah, absolutely. Um, so yeah, I, you, in that case

745
00:34:58.215 --> 00:35:03.055
for an interview style video, you could, like, I will say

746
00:35:03.055 --> 00:35:05.495
that intros and interviews tend

747
00:35:05.495 --> 00:35:06.855
to be a little bit different,

748
00:35:06.915 --> 00:35:10.175
but you can still have input bias one

749
00:35:10.175 --> 00:35:11.655
by having just like a higher production

750
00:35:11.655 --> 00:35:13.055
quality intro itself.

751
00:35:13.355 --> 00:35:15.535
But even like mentioning, you know,

752
00:35:15.875 --> 00:35:20.455
how much work went into the preparation of this interview

753
00:35:20.455 --> 00:35:21.495
that you've done, um,

754
00:35:21.685 --> 00:35:23.695
that like show effort going into there.

755
00:35:24.635 --> 00:35:29.115
So any questions on input bias

756
00:35:29.575 --> 00:35:33.275
or on context or curiosity apps, this is your chance

757
00:35:33.275 --> 00:35:35.995
to ask them because soon we're going

758
00:35:35.995 --> 00:35:39.935
to go into actually writing them, um,

759
00:35:40.985 --> 00:35:43.295
doing a video on how to find hotels in sfs.

760
00:35:43.295 --> 00:35:47.615
My input bias would be my actual stays at set hotels.

761
00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:49.735
So yeah, for, for that.

762
00:35:49.955 --> 00:35:53.575
In, in that case for how to find hotels in San Francisco,

763
00:35:54.205 --> 00:35:58.525
your input bias might be, you know, like

764
00:35:59.535 --> 00:36:03.095
I tried, you know, five different methods

765
00:36:03.795 --> 00:36:05.255
of finding hotels

766
00:36:05.275 --> 00:36:06.935
and this is the one that's worked the best.

767
00:36:07.595 --> 00:36:08.775
You, you don't even have

768
00:36:08.775 --> 00:36:11.255
to mention the other five methods that you've tried.

769
00:36:11.315 --> 00:36:13.335
You can just, you know, just talk about the one

770
00:36:13.335 --> 00:36:14.935
that you're going to talk about in the video.

771
00:36:15.475 --> 00:36:18.615
But by even like implying that you've tried other things,

772
00:36:19.155 --> 00:36:21.055
it signals to the viewer, oh,

773
00:36:21.055 --> 00:36:22.655
there's extra value being done here.

774
00:36:23.115 --> 00:36:24.855
So it's like one, I'm not sure if

775
00:36:24.855 --> 00:36:28.015
that's exactly the structure of your intro,

776
00:36:28.155 --> 00:36:30.255
but that's kind of an example there.

777
00:36:30.755 --> 00:36:35.365
Um, yeah, the how to find hotels and save.

778
00:36:35.365 --> 00:36:37.405
Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, in that case, just like

779
00:36:37.505 --> 00:36:40.725
by mentioning that you've done the work for the viewer

780
00:36:40.905 --> 00:36:42.245
to do, try all these things

781
00:36:42.505 --> 00:36:44.525
and you will only show them the one

782
00:36:44.525 --> 00:36:46.405
that works best, that's a way to do it.

783
00:36:46.945 --> 00:36:49.125
Um, does it vary from niche to niche?

784
00:36:49.265 --> 00:36:51.805
For example, challenge explainer content versus more of vlog

785
00:36:52.785 --> 00:36:56.845
any type of niche that you have, you can, IM,

786
00:36:56.845 --> 00:36:58.885
you can leverage input bias in some way.

787
00:36:59.305 --> 00:37:01.845
So for a, uh,

788
00:37:02.345 --> 00:37:04.525
and I assume you're talking about input bias,

789
00:37:04.705 --> 00:37:06.365
but it does apply to like context

790
00:37:06.425 --> 00:37:07.485
and curiosity gaps as well.

791
00:37:07.745 --> 00:37:11.605
No matter the niche, you're going to need to provide context

792
00:37:12.155 --> 00:37:14.765
into what it is that you're doing on that day

793
00:37:14.865 --> 00:37:16.325
and maybe why you're doing it.

794
00:37:16.465 --> 00:37:18.205
You're going to need to create a curiosity gap.

795
00:37:18.445 --> 00:37:21.405
'cause even with a vlog, you need to open something,

796
00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:22.405
you need to open a loop.

797
00:37:22.865 --> 00:37:24.965
Um, for vlogs, the loop doesn't have

798
00:37:24.965 --> 00:37:26.325
to be entirely sensational,

799
00:37:26.345 --> 00:37:28.605
but it can be like, you know, you're, you're, you're going

800
00:37:28.605 --> 00:37:30.965
to be trying a new restaurant that day

801
00:37:30.965 --> 00:37:32.245
that you've never tried before.

802
00:37:32.615 --> 00:37:35.045
Let's see how it is. You know, like even that is like,

803
00:37:35.045 --> 00:37:36.205
okay, opening a loop.

804
00:37:36.785 --> 00:37:39.565
And in terms of input bias, input bias

805
00:37:39.625 --> 00:37:42.445
and logs usually tend

806
00:37:42.445 --> 00:37:44.325
to be something a little bit different.

807
00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:47.205
It used to usually shows up more implicitly in terms of

808
00:37:47.985 --> 00:37:51.045
the like, style of vlog that you're filming.

809
00:37:51.275 --> 00:37:53.405
Like what are your cinematics, like,

810
00:37:53.405 --> 00:37:55.645
what is your production quality like, even humor

811
00:37:55.785 --> 00:37:58.885
and personality can be an indicator of input bias

812
00:37:59.155 --> 00:38:01.965
because you're showing something more about yourself

813
00:38:01.965 --> 00:38:03.445
that most people don't Like.

814
00:38:03.445 --> 00:38:06.565
If you're a funny person in, you're being able

815
00:38:06.565 --> 00:38:07.645
to like crack a joke

816
00:38:07.705 --> 00:38:10.525
or make humor, make someone chuckle within your intro,

817
00:38:11.025 --> 00:38:13.045
that's gonna be extra effort that you put in there

818
00:38:13.045 --> 00:38:14.045
that most people didn't.

819
00:38:15.015 --> 00:38:16.835
So with all

820
00:38:16.835 --> 00:38:20.715
that being said, now it's your turn.

821
00:38:21.095 --> 00:38:24.035
So we're going to write the rest of our intro.

822
00:38:24.095 --> 00:38:25.115
Yes, the rest of our intro.

823
00:38:25.815 --> 00:38:29.445
You got this, you're only going to need to do three things.

824
00:38:29.905 --> 00:38:32.005
So provide the context, the what

825
00:38:32.105 --> 00:38:35.685
and maybe the why, uh, you want to create one

826
00:38:35.685 --> 00:38:36.805
or more curiosity gaps.

827
00:38:36.865 --> 00:38:39.405
How can you open a loop that gives people wanting

828
00:38:39.405 --> 00:38:40.565
to stay to find the answer?

829
00:38:41.065 --> 00:38:43.685
And then how can you leverage input bias?

830
00:38:44.385 --> 00:38:48.245
Um, and the order in which you establish these three things

831
00:38:48.545 --> 00:38:49.605
are up to you.

832
00:38:50.225 --> 00:38:55.125
Uh, I typically like to have a curiosity gap.

833
00:38:55.225 --> 00:38:57.725
Be one of the last line of my intro

834
00:38:57.915 --> 00:38:59.685
because that kinda leads in

835
00:39:00.265 --> 00:39:02.125
pretty directly to the rest of my video.

836
00:39:02.545 --> 00:39:05.685
But you can have it be before or after input bias up to you.

837
00:39:06.345 --> 00:39:08.805
And remember, try to keep your intro overall five

838
00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:09.965
to sentences along total.

839
00:39:10.745 --> 00:39:14.085
Uh, we've already done one, so four to six sentences left.

840
00:39:14.145 --> 00:39:16.205
So I'm gonna give, give, I'm gonna give you six minutes

841
00:39:16.225 --> 00:39:18.885
to do this one minute per sentence that you're writing,

842
00:39:18.885 --> 00:39:20.605
which again is luxury.

843
00:39:21.745 --> 00:39:25.845
So, um, Cody, I see you've already like gone ahead on this.

844
00:39:25.845 --> 00:39:30.245
Awesome. I'll start the timer and I will see you guys then.

845
00:45:36.545 --> 00:45:41.325
All right. Uh, yeah, just put in the chat

846
00:45:41.665 --> 00:45:45.565
for Cody, just like a, a example rewrite

847
00:45:45.565 --> 00:45:46.685
of the intro that you put in there.

848
00:45:47.225 --> 00:45:50.645
Um, but that was the end of the six minutes.

849
00:45:51.865 --> 00:45:55.365
Uh, hopefully you guys

850
00:45:55.995 --> 00:45:58.645
have now made an intro.

851
00:45:58.925 --> 00:46:01.165
I mean, how, how many of you now have an intro

852
00:46:01.195 --> 00:46:02.685
that meets exploitation?

853
00:46:02.685 --> 00:46:05.365
The title and thumbnail provides context, creates one

854
00:46:05.365 --> 00:46:07.445
of more curiosity gaps and leverages input bias.

855
00:46:08.105 --> 00:46:09.685
Um, you don't have to put it in the chat,

856
00:46:09.865 --> 00:46:13.125
but maybe just like a, like a thumbs up, a thumbs sideways,

857
00:46:13.145 --> 00:46:17.645
thumbs down, uh, on how we're feeling about this so far.

858
00:46:18.105 --> 00:46:21.165
And if there are any brave souls out there who want to share

859
00:46:21.735 --> 00:46:25.045
their intro, um, go ahead and put it in the chat.

860
00:46:25.265 --> 00:46:26.645
I'd love to give feedback.

861
00:46:27.105 --> 00:46:32.045
Um, we talked a little bit with Cody in terms

862
00:46:32.065 --> 00:46:36.685
of like shifting an intro from

863
00:46:37.815 --> 00:46:41.835
the first version, which was, do you know

864
00:46:41.835 --> 00:46:43.315
how far you can go with 30 steps?

865
00:46:43.815 --> 00:46:45.035
But, but with 30 K steps,

866
00:46:45.205 --> 00:46:47.835
let's find out over the next 30 days I'll be doing this

867
00:46:47.835 --> 00:46:50.555
by taking 30 K steps every day over the next 30 days.

868
00:46:51.095 --> 00:46:52.635
Why am I doing this to prove

869
00:46:52.635 --> 00:46:54.515
that it's not only possible, but surprisingly simple.

870
00:46:55.095 --> 00:46:56.755
I'm doing this to build the best image of myself.

871
00:46:56.935 --> 00:46:58.115
So may have already struggled with,

872
00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:01.315
and I'm still do this is making, this is me making

873
00:47:01.315 --> 00:47:05.035
that change and showing you how easy it is to do the same.

874
00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:06.795
So that was like the first version.

875
00:47:07.175 --> 00:47:12.135
And then some main, um,

876
00:47:14.185 --> 00:47:15.325
pieces of feedback.

877
00:47:15.325 --> 00:47:19.165
There was one, the first sentence saying like how

878
00:47:19.865 --> 00:47:22.125
far you can go in general, it's just like a bit vague.

879
00:47:22.825 --> 00:47:27.285
Uh, Cody brought up that they wanted

880
00:47:27.505 --> 00:47:29.845
to let the viewer choose the goal, which is something

881
00:47:29.845 --> 00:47:33.965
that I see a lot in intros as well is the concept of like

882
00:47:35.355 --> 00:47:37.325
purposely keeping things vague,

883
00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:42.335
but in like 99% of cases,

884
00:47:42.675 --> 00:47:45.695
making things vague to try to like evoke more,

885
00:47:45.695 --> 00:47:49.095
more curiosity actually has the opposite effect.

886
00:47:49.285 --> 00:47:52.575
When a viewer wants to click on a video, they don't want

887
00:47:52.595 --> 00:47:56.095
to have to do the work to figure out what the video is going

888
00:47:56.095 --> 00:47:58.095
to be about or what it's going to mean.

889
00:47:58.485 --> 00:48:00.815
They want to be told they just want to sit there

890
00:48:00.815 --> 00:48:02.295
and have the experience brought to them.

891
00:48:02.675 --> 00:48:03.855
So being really specific

892
00:48:04.595 --> 00:48:06.535
and you know, maybe you're mentioning

893
00:48:06.535 --> 00:48:08.375
that you're tracking a couple of different metrics

894
00:48:08.395 --> 00:48:13.015
during this time is going to allow them to self insert into

895
00:48:13.045 --> 00:48:16.335
that way and identify with something that you're doing

896
00:48:16.475 --> 00:48:18.295
and then they'll continue from there.

897
00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:20.415
So being more specific

898
00:48:20.635 --> 00:48:23.495
and having like a clearer curiosity gap, uh, things

899
00:48:23.495 --> 00:48:27.865
that I would recommend there, um, get, get

900
00:48:27.865 --> 00:48:28.705
to the point right away

901
00:48:28.705 --> 00:48:29.945
wasn't all the way up that way on YouTube.

902
00:48:29.975 --> 00:48:32.665
Yeah, absolutely. It's, it's, try to get to the point

903
00:48:32.765 --> 00:48:33.785
as quickly as it can.

904
00:48:34.195 --> 00:48:35.745
Don't keep things purposely vague.

905
00:48:35.885 --> 00:48:37.505
Be as specific as possible.

906
00:48:38.285 --> 00:48:41.465
And let me show you, um, how

907
00:48:43.545 --> 00:48:45.785
I approached this intro.

908
00:48:46.605 --> 00:48:49.905
So first of all, we had the first bit,

909
00:48:49.905 --> 00:48:51.305
which is this is a step,

910
00:48:51.365 --> 00:48:54.065
and over the next 30 days I'll be doing 30,000

911
00:48:54.065 --> 00:48:55.425
of them per day.

912
00:48:56.355 --> 00:48:58.465
Great. We went over that first sentence.

913
00:48:59.085 --> 00:49:02.265
Um, then we moved to the context, which is

914
00:49:02.535 --> 00:49:04.705
because over the last few months I've been

915
00:49:04.705 --> 00:49:05.865
more sedentary than ever.

916
00:49:06.405 --> 00:49:08.545
At any point you can find me sitting from my computer

917
00:49:08.695 --> 00:49:11.305
scrolling in my phone or becoming one with my couch.

918
00:49:11.965 --> 00:49:13.345
But that all changes today.

919
00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:17.345
So we have this context of like, why, why am I doing this?

920
00:49:17.345 --> 00:49:18.585
I've been more sedentary than ever.

921
00:49:18.985 --> 00:49:20.945
I don't really need to give a what in this case

922
00:49:20.945 --> 00:49:24.865
because most people understand the concept of 30,000 steps,

923
00:49:25.125 --> 00:49:26.545
um, in a 30 day challenge.

924
00:49:27.005 --> 00:49:29.305
And then was saying, but that all changes today establishes

925
00:49:29.305 --> 00:49:31.105
the context that today is day one.

926
00:49:31.485 --> 00:49:33.985
Um, bye Sam, thanks for being here.

927
00:49:35.615 --> 00:49:38.325
After I, I have my context, I move into the curiosity gap

928
00:49:38.385 --> 00:49:40.445
and at this point I'm gonna switch over to voiceover

929
00:49:40.585 --> 00:49:43.085
and say, when I sat down this challenge, I knew

930
00:49:43.085 --> 00:49:44.965
that I was bound to see some changes by day 30,

931
00:49:45.505 --> 00:49:48.165
but in hindsight, I dramatically underestimated just

932
00:49:48.165 --> 00:49:49.565
how much this video would change me

933
00:49:49.565 --> 00:49:51.685
emotionally, mentally, and physically.

934
00:49:52.745 --> 00:49:55.365
So at this point, I'm opening a curiosity gap

935
00:49:55.515 --> 00:49:58.925
because the viewer wants to watch, find out just

936
00:49:58.925 --> 00:50:01.205
how much I was changed, how did I

937
00:50:02.075 --> 00:50:03.725
underestimate what happened.

938
00:50:04.185 --> 00:50:05.245
And here as well,

939
00:50:05.345 --> 00:50:08.885
in the very end when I say like I changed physically,

940
00:50:09.365 --> 00:50:12.245
I can also visually tease some sort of transformation

941
00:50:12.245 --> 00:50:13.885
of like a before and the after have the

942
00:50:13.885 --> 00:50:15.965
after pixelated out or something else like that.

943
00:50:16.425 --> 00:50:18.285
So it opens this loop to be like, oh, like

944
00:50:18.435 --> 00:50:19.765
what was the change that happened?

945
00:50:19.895 --> 00:50:22.205
Let's keep watching to figure out, um,

946
00:50:22.255 --> 00:50:24.325
especially within this like self-improvement

947
00:50:24.345 --> 00:50:25.685
and fitness space as well.

948
00:50:26.305 --> 00:50:28.445
The concept of transformations tend

949
00:50:28.445 --> 00:50:30.645
to be a very strong curiosity act

950
00:50:30.645 --> 00:50:33.165
because most people want to undergo some sort

951
00:50:33.165 --> 00:50:34.205
of transformation themselves.

952
00:50:34.585 --> 00:50:37.245
So promising a strong transformation makes them want

953
00:50:37.245 --> 00:50:39.365
to watch to see if they can do so too.

954
00:50:39.945 --> 00:50:41.965
Um, it's curiosity the stakes here.

955
00:50:42.545 --> 00:50:46.245
So, uh, curiosity could,

956
00:50:46.425 --> 00:50:50.965
the curiosity gap could be stakes in my intro, it's not

957
00:50:50.965 --> 00:50:52.845
because I'm not really having stakes here,

958
00:50:53.305 --> 00:50:56.885
but you could insert stakes if you wanted to.

959
00:50:56.945 --> 00:50:59.045
And those stakes could be the curiosity gap.

960
00:50:59.145 --> 00:51:02.405
So for instance, you could say something like,

961
00:51:02.425 --> 00:51:03.685
if you were doing this challenge

962
00:51:03.905 --> 00:51:07.685
and you wanted to track your like metrics

963
00:51:08.195 --> 00:51:11.645
over the time, you could insert some sort of stakes on

964
00:51:11.645 --> 00:51:13.125
what happens if you don't,

965
00:51:13.465 --> 00:51:15.405
or a reward that you're gonna have if

966
00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:16.525
you do hit those things.

967
00:51:16.865 --> 00:51:19.965
And then those stakes create this additional payoff

968
00:51:19.965 --> 00:51:23.005
that could happen in the future, which is, oh, like one,

969
00:51:23.305 --> 00:51:25.565
how much do their me do, like their metrics change,

970
00:51:25.945 --> 00:51:30.005
but then two, are they able to either get that reward

971
00:51:30.265 --> 00:51:31.605
or, um, avoid

972
00:51:31.605 --> 00:51:34.045
that punishment if you're setting up stakes in that way.

973
00:51:35.155 --> 00:51:38.895
And so in this sample in show that I put together,

974
00:51:38.995 --> 00:51:40.815
we have the context, we have the curiosity gap,

975
00:51:41.235 --> 00:51:43.775
but what about the input bias?

976
00:51:44.445 --> 00:51:48.135
Well, in this video I chose to indicate effort not

977
00:51:48.135 --> 00:51:51.295
through words, but through visuals, um,

978
00:51:51.565 --> 00:51:52.815
with this sentence right here.

979
00:51:53.155 --> 00:51:55.735
So this is gonna be a voiceover where I verbalize words

980
00:51:55.875 --> 00:51:58.575
and I'm gonna show myself walking in a variety

981
00:51:58.675 --> 00:52:02.175
of interesting and, uh, where, where verbalize words.

982
00:52:02.635 --> 00:52:04.935
But during this time, I'm also going

983
00:52:04.935 --> 00:52:09.415
to show myself like walking in a variety of very interesting

984
00:52:09.415 --> 00:52:11.855
and stunning places, just like some like neat locations.

985
00:52:12.555 --> 00:52:14.175
And just by showing

986
00:52:14.285 --> 00:52:17.455
that I'm gonna be walking in different places, it signals

987
00:52:17.455 --> 00:52:19.655
to the viewer, oh, it's not just gonna be her

988
00:52:19.655 --> 00:52:20.935
walking around her neighborhood.

989
00:52:21.395 --> 00:52:23.735
I'm gonna be taken on this like journey to all

990
00:52:23.735 --> 00:52:25.855
of these other places as we go along there.

991
00:52:26.355 --> 00:52:28.775
And it's going to be more interesting

992
00:52:28.775 --> 00:52:29.855
than I originally thought.

993
00:52:30.395 --> 00:52:33.885
So that's how I would leverage input bias within this video.

994
00:52:34.585 --> 00:52:36.965
And this tactic of implementing input bias

995
00:52:37.045 --> 00:52:39.485
through visuals brings us to the third

996
00:52:39.585 --> 00:52:43.925
and final step in making a killer YouTube intro, which is

997
00:52:44.445 --> 00:52:47.085
determining your visuals and constructing your shot list.

998
00:52:47.515 --> 00:52:51.365
Because the best intros don't just tell you what's going on,

999
00:52:51.795 --> 00:52:53.365
they show it happening.

1000
00:52:53.865 --> 00:52:55.445
And especially with the adoption

1001
00:52:55.445 --> 00:52:58.885
of YouTube's autoplay feature, it's not uncommon for someone

1002
00:52:58.905 --> 00:53:02.325
to view a video's intro entirely without sound.

1003
00:53:03.025 --> 00:53:04.405
So to peak a viewer's interest

1004
00:53:04.405 --> 00:53:07.125
and keep them watching your intro should be captivating

1005
00:53:07.125 --> 00:53:10.765
enough to draw someone in, even if they can't hear a thing.

1006
00:53:11.995 --> 00:53:15.525
When Mark Rober provides context about what Wiffle Ball is,

1007
00:53:15.675 --> 00:53:18.005
he's not just sitting at a desk telling you about it,

1008
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:19.325
he's showing you examples.

1009
00:53:19.325 --> 00:53:20.445
You're being able to watch this

1010
00:53:20.505 --> 00:53:22.005
and see people playing wiffle ball.

1011
00:53:22.625 --> 00:53:25.485
So as you plan out your intro, i I want you to go

1012
00:53:25.485 --> 00:53:28.405
through your script and write down what visuals can be used

1013
00:53:28.625 --> 00:53:30.805
to show what you're talking about.

1014
00:53:31.665 --> 00:53:34.205
So here's more of what I mean.

1015
00:53:34.845 --> 00:53:37.565
I like to break it up into ears and eyes.

1016
00:53:37.755 --> 00:53:40.085
What is the viewer hearing? What is the viewer seeing?

1017
00:53:40.625 --> 00:53:44.605
So in this case, in my sample intro example, like this is,

1018
00:53:44.675 --> 00:53:46.885
this is a step and it can show a closeup

1019
00:53:46.905 --> 00:53:49.165
of me taking a step, I can say,

1020
00:53:49.345 --> 00:53:51.085
and over the next 30 days, I'm going

1021
00:53:51.085 --> 00:53:52.805
to be doing 30,000 of them per day.

1022
00:53:53.025 --> 00:53:54.365
That's what the viewer will hear.

1023
00:53:54.365 --> 00:53:57.365
What they'll see is me walking over to like a whiteboard.

1024
00:53:57.425 --> 00:53:59.445
I'm envisioning like a big whiteboard

1025
00:53:59.835 --> 00:54:02.005
with like a calendar drawn on it.

1026
00:54:02.225 --> 00:54:05.085
And then like each of the day is being checked off kind

1027
00:54:05.085 --> 00:54:06.885
of like in a neat visual during like the,

1028
00:54:06.885 --> 00:54:09.165
I'll be doing 30,000 of them per day

1029
00:54:10.065 --> 00:54:14.265
and planning out what's going

1030
00:54:14.265 --> 00:54:15.705
to be happening on screen.

1031
00:54:16.055 --> 00:54:19.025
That, that little extra step, that little extra process

1032
00:54:19.205 --> 00:54:22.545
of writing your intro is gonna help you tremendously when it

1033
00:54:22.545 --> 00:54:23.985
comes to constructing a final product

1034
00:54:24.015 --> 00:54:25.825
that people actually want to watch through.

1035
00:54:26.645 --> 00:54:28.385
Now when it comes to the different visuals

1036
00:54:28.385 --> 00:54:30.665
that you have at your disposal to choose from,

1037
00:54:31.005 --> 00:54:32.065
you have a few options.

1038
00:54:32.945 --> 00:54:34.205
The first is a roll.

1039
00:54:34.425 --> 00:54:36.525
So this is where someone is speaking directly to the camera.

1040
00:54:36.945 --> 00:54:40.605
You'll typically see this in like talking head videos, like,

1041
00:54:40.725 --> 00:54:43.685
I mean, even what I'm doing right now is a roll essentially

1042
00:54:43.685 --> 00:54:44.925
where I'm talking directly to the camera,

1043
00:54:45.385 --> 00:54:47.325
but you don't have to be at your desk if you don't want to.

1044
00:54:47.345 --> 00:54:49.765
You can also talk to the camera while you're standing up

1045
00:54:49.785 --> 00:54:51.645
or walking around as long as you're micd up.

1046
00:54:52.025 --> 00:54:53.645
So that's a roll. Um,

1047
00:54:53.965 --> 00:54:55.885
B roll is supplementary footage you can film

1048
00:54:56.225 --> 00:54:58.765
and that can be categorized typically into like wide shots,

1049
00:54:58.975 --> 00:55:01.405
which establish a location to set a scene.

1050
00:55:01.785 --> 00:55:02.885
You have medium shots,

1051
00:55:02.935 --> 00:55:05.565
which can capture the subject and the environment.

1052
00:55:05.565 --> 00:55:09.165
In equal focus there are closeups which highlight details.

1053
00:55:09.345 --> 00:55:11.445
And then you have the extremes, extreme wide shots,

1054
00:55:11.615 --> 00:55:13.245
which give your viewers a sense of awe

1055
00:55:13.245 --> 00:55:16.925
and scale, which is typically done through drone footage.

1056
00:55:17.955 --> 00:55:19.645
Your girl doesn't have a drone yet,

1057
00:55:19.825 --> 00:55:23.045
but I think it'll be cool to adopt one one day,

1058
00:55:23.385 --> 00:55:26.925
add a little extra spice into the YouTube strategy scene,

1059
00:55:27.425 --> 00:55:29.325
and then extreme closeups as well,

1060
00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:32.485
which emphasize micro details for dramatic effect.

1061
00:55:33.475 --> 00:55:36.855
Um, you can also use text, it can emphasize a key point

1062
00:55:36.955 --> 00:55:38.295
and provide additional context.

1063
00:55:38.915 --> 00:55:41.375
Uh, I also like to use text just

1064
00:55:41.755 --> 00:55:46.415
to emphasize like a key juicy like statement or question.

1065
00:55:46.525 --> 00:55:48.575
I'll just do kinda like full screen text as well.

1066
00:55:49.235 --> 00:55:51.815
Um, screen recordings help viewers follow along

1067
00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:53.215
as you explain something, especially if

1068
00:55:53.215 --> 00:55:54.375
you're doing something more digital.

1069
00:55:54.705 --> 00:55:55.935
Being able to show

1070
00:55:55.935 --> 00:55:58.055
what you're doing on the screen can be really useful.

1071
00:55:58.595 --> 00:56:01.935
Um, images or icons can provide visual references if you're

1072
00:56:01.935 --> 00:56:04.255
talking about things you can use icons

1073
00:56:04.275 --> 00:56:06.255
to like visualize the thing that you're doing.

1074
00:56:06.955 --> 00:56:09.015
Um, we have external clips

1075
00:56:09.195 --> 00:56:12.495
so you can provide context if you're talking about like a

1076
00:56:12.495 --> 00:56:14.855
movie or talking about some sort of external media,

1077
00:56:15.035 --> 00:56:17.335
you can show that it's also a great way to add humor,

1078
00:56:17.435 --> 00:56:18.935
but like inserting like a meme

1079
00:56:18.995 --> 00:56:21.455
or something from time to time could be another way just

1080
00:56:21.455 --> 00:56:23.725
to inject more personality into your intro

1081
00:56:23.785 --> 00:56:24.925
or any other part of your video.

1082
00:56:25.665 --> 00:56:27.245
And then finally, we have motion graphics.

1083
00:56:27.745 --> 00:56:29.525
And these can illustrate key points.

1084
00:56:29.755 --> 00:56:31.765
They're often used to explain complex ideas.

1085
00:56:32.345 --> 00:56:34.245
And motion graphics are a great way

1086
00:56:34.245 --> 00:56:36.605
to leverage input bios within your intros as well

1087
00:56:36.675 --> 00:56:38.365
because not many people can do them.

1088
00:56:38.425 --> 00:56:40.365
So if you can do motion graphics,

1089
00:56:40.515 --> 00:56:43.725
showing them there just elevates your video

1090
00:56:43.985 --> 00:56:46.685
and lets viewers know like, oh, like we're in for a treat.

1091
00:56:46.695 --> 00:56:47.885
We're going to get a lot there.

1092
00:56:49.115 --> 00:56:53.175
And how granular you want to be with your

1093
00:56:53.965 --> 00:56:56.415
visuals as you go out visually planning your intro

1094
00:56:56.715 --> 00:56:57.775
is up to you.

1095
00:56:57.995 --> 00:57:00.615
So this is what it typically looks like for me.

1096
00:57:01.075 --> 00:57:03.255
Uh, I like to script everything in notion.

1097
00:57:03.275 --> 00:57:04.935
So you're seeing notion. And

1098
00:57:04.935 --> 00:57:06.615
what you're seeing right now is essentially

1099
00:57:06.755 --> 00:57:10.295
for every like phrase I have made a comment

1100
00:57:10.835 --> 00:57:15.015
and that comment is me annotating what the viewer is seeing

1101
00:57:15.195 --> 00:57:16.215
during those parts.

1102
00:57:16.875 --> 00:57:18.655
Uh, you can see there are like letters

1103
00:57:18.925 --> 00:57:21.695
that I have in like in the front of the comment

1104
00:57:22.265 --> 00:57:23.975
those signify like, is this B roll?

1105
00:57:23.995 --> 00:57:25.655
Is this a roll V is visual.

1106
00:57:26.195 --> 00:57:28.535
The other types I'll normally do is, is this text

1107
00:57:28.555 --> 00:57:29.975
or is this screen recordings?

1108
00:57:29.985 --> 00:57:31.335
Those are the main ones

1109
00:57:31.335 --> 00:57:32.695
that I typically use within my own videos.

1110
00:57:33.435 --> 00:57:35.375
And you can also see that some

1111
00:57:35.375 --> 00:57:37.695
of the phrases are highlighted in blue.

1112
00:57:38.195 --> 00:57:41.095
And what that is, is actually a technique that I like to use

1113
00:57:41.115 --> 00:57:42.815
to help me while filming.

1114
00:57:43.435 --> 00:57:45.335
Uh, because when I'm filming I can look down

1115
00:57:45.355 --> 00:57:46.855
and see whatever I highlight in blue.

1116
00:57:47.125 --> 00:57:49.975
That is what I know is going to be a roll.

1117
00:57:49.975 --> 00:57:52.175
That is what I know in the finished product is going

1118
00:57:52.175 --> 00:57:53.935
to be me talking directly to the camera.

1119
00:57:54.675 --> 00:57:56.695
So I'll make sure I deliver those

1120
00:57:56.875 --> 00:57:59.455
to the camera versus the other ones I'm like, oh,

1121
00:57:59.455 --> 00:58:01.135
this is gonna be covered up by other stuff.

1122
00:58:01.355 --> 00:58:02.855
So I can just do voiceover for that.

1123
00:58:03.435 --> 00:58:05.535
So it makes filming a lot easier versus having

1124
00:58:05.595 --> 00:58:08.455
to like present the entire video directly to my camera.

1125
00:58:08.845 --> 00:58:10.095
It's a lot easier to read off

1126
00:58:10.095 --> 00:58:11.935
of a screen versus having to present it all.

1127
00:58:12.875 --> 00:58:15.735
And this is the format that I like to use

1128
00:58:15.735 --> 00:58:16.815
for my visual annotations.

1129
00:58:17.075 --> 00:58:19.455
Uh, other people I know like to do something more like this

1130
00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:22.255
where they have an ears column, an eyes column,

1131
00:58:22.355 --> 00:58:25.095
and maybe like a type column, um, where you can see more

1132
00:58:25.095 --> 00:58:28.095
of like a one-to-one ratio of what is

1133
00:58:28.095 --> 00:58:30.455
what the viewer is hearing and what the viewer is seeing.

1134
00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:33.855
And the great part is that

1135
00:58:33.855 --> 00:58:35.575
after you do all of this, you can make,

1136
00:58:35.915 --> 00:58:38.135
you can take your visual annotations that you've made

1137
00:58:38.475 --> 00:58:40.015
and make a shot list out of that.

1138
00:58:40.435 --> 00:58:43.535
So in this case, I would make a list of like closeup

1139
00:58:43.595 --> 00:58:47.055
of like taking a step, uh, me slash in front of my computer,

1140
00:58:47.315 --> 00:58:48.495
me and bed scrolling on my phone,

1141
00:58:48.755 --> 00:58:49.975
me being a DJ on the couch.

1142
00:58:50.595 --> 00:58:53.855
Um, and those all become a shot list for myself.

1143
00:58:53.875 --> 00:58:54.935
So when I go out into filming,

1144
00:58:55.375 --> 00:58:57.895
I can really easily just grab all the footage that I need.

1145
00:58:58.075 --> 00:59:00.735
So when it comes to editing the killer intro that I want

1146
00:59:00.735 --> 00:59:03.975
to make, I have all those resources available to me.

1147
00:59:03.995 --> 00:59:06.015
And I'm never stuck being like, man,

1148
00:59:06.275 --> 00:59:09.055
if only I had this footage, I would do this.

1149
00:59:09.085 --> 00:59:11.255
Like, nope, I got everything that I need

1150
00:59:11.255 --> 00:59:12.495
because I do the work beforehand.

1151
00:59:13.435 --> 00:59:16.975
Um, and of course we're going to do this together,

1152
00:59:17.115 --> 00:59:18.735
of course, we're gonna be taking our intros

1153
00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:21.885
and applying, uh, a visual annotation to this.

1154
00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:25.765
But I'm going to drop in this just essentially this,

1155
00:59:25.785 --> 00:59:27.325
but as a template for you guys,

1156
00:59:27.545 --> 00:59:28.565
I'm putting that in the chat.

1157
00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:31.805
Um, just, uh, Google sheets you can use

1158
00:59:32.305 --> 00:59:34.285
and yeah, just make sure that if you use this,

1159
00:59:34.305 --> 00:59:37.405
you just go into file and make a copy to, you can't work off

1160
00:59:37.405 --> 00:59:39.085
of the version, so just make a copy

1161
00:59:39.385 --> 00:59:42.805
and then you can use this to serve as the basis

1162
00:59:42.865 --> 00:59:44.285
for your own visual annotations.

1163
00:59:44.785 --> 00:59:47.605
If you don't want to just comment it out like I normally do.

1164
00:59:48.665 --> 00:59:51.925
So once again, now it is your turn.

1165
00:59:52.065 --> 00:59:53.445
I'm gonna give you another six minutes

1166
00:59:53.545 --> 00:59:55.205
to make your visual annotations.

1167
00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:57.485
And as you go through your annotations,

1168
00:59:58.035 --> 01:00:01.285
another thing you might realize is that you don't have to

1169
01:00:02.245 --> 01:00:04.085
verbally always say something.

1170
01:00:04.745 --> 01:00:09.355
So there are cases where on YouTube in general,

1171
01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:11.995
it's always best to show, not tell.

1172
01:00:12.055 --> 01:00:15.035
So if there are a case where like, oh, I'm saying this,

1173
01:00:15.335 --> 01:00:17.315
but I could show this instead.

1174
01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:21.955
Normally by default you wanna choose the showing of it.

1175
01:00:22.335 --> 01:00:24.395
So for instance, mark Rober, in the end

1176
01:00:24.395 --> 01:00:27.435
of his intro didn't need to verbally list out or like say,

1177
01:00:28.015 --> 01:00:30.715
and by the way, it's not just the ball that I've made,

1178
01:00:30.715 --> 01:00:32.195
I've done all of these other things as well

1179
01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:35.035
because he can just show the base plate moving

1180
01:00:35.295 --> 01:00:37.755
and that's much more effective than him just saying it.

1181
01:00:38.295 --> 01:00:40.475
Um, I say, well, what was the platform I used for my script?

1182
01:00:40.615 --> 01:00:42.435
Uh, I use notion myself.

1183
01:00:43.815 --> 01:00:47.395
And so I'm gonna give you six minutes once again to,

1184
01:00:47.695 --> 01:00:49.195
you can use that template if you want to,

1185
01:00:49.535 --> 01:00:50.955
to make your visual annotations

1186
01:00:51.255 --> 01:00:55.555
and to cut down any extraneous sentences that you have,

1187
01:00:55.855 --> 01:00:57.195
any ones that you realize, Hmm,

1188
01:00:57.235 --> 01:00:58.475
I don't really need this anymore

1189
01:00:58.475 --> 01:01:00.555
because I have a visual that can show this better.

1190
01:01:01.495 --> 01:01:03.275
And I'll see you afterwards.

1191
01:07:05.665 --> 01:07:07.205
All right, welcome back.

1192
01:07:07.665 --> 01:07:10.565
Uh, as we might say, pencils down,

1193
01:07:10.655 --> 01:07:11.725
which hopefully is a phrase

1194
01:07:11.755 --> 01:07:13.565
that doesn't give you too much trauma.

1195
01:07:13.585 --> 01:07:16.245
If you've taken a lot of standardized tests in the past, uh,

1196
01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:19.805
it still kind of gives me the ick, but welcome back.

1197
01:07:20.065 --> 01:07:21.845
Uh, and hopefully at this point

1198
01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:26.165
you have at least an 80% ready to go intro.

1199
01:07:26.325 --> 01:07:29.685
I feel like in most intros it normally takes me a couple

1200
01:07:29.685 --> 01:07:31.205
different iterations to get to

1201
01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:33.245
where it is a hundred percent of the time.

1202
01:07:33.725 --> 01:07:34.925
I think the best thing that you can do

1203
01:07:34.935 --> 01:07:37.725
after you've gone through this process is going back

1204
01:07:37.785 --> 01:07:40.245
to YouTube friends that you have and getting feedback

1205
01:07:40.245 --> 01:07:43.205
and saying like, oh, asking them is this interesting?

1206
01:07:43.205 --> 01:07:44.365
Does this keep your attention?

1207
01:07:44.915 --> 01:07:47.285
Does this open a big enough curiosity gap for you?

1208
01:07:47.345 --> 01:07:48.565
Are you interested enough to keep

1209
01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:49.845
washing through to the end?

1210
01:07:50.745 --> 01:07:53.925
And whether you ended up using this sample title

1211
01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:56.005
and thumbnail or using your own,

1212
01:07:56.665 --> 01:07:57.845
we don't need to listen to that again.

1213
01:07:58.225 --> 01:07:59.925
Um, hopefully you can now see

1214
01:07:59.925 --> 01:08:02.525
how this intro formula can be applied to different types

1215
01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.245
of niche, different types of formats.

1216
01:08:04.245 --> 01:08:06.605
It can be used for a variety of different types of videos

1217
01:08:07.225 --> 01:08:10.165
and consistently has been shown

1218
01:08:10.345 --> 01:08:12.845
to perform quite well when it comes

1219
01:08:12.845 --> 01:08:14.645
to keeping retention for the first 30 seconds.

1220
01:08:15.545 --> 01:08:19.045
And at this point, thank you so much for watching.

1221
01:08:19.045 --> 01:08:21.925
Thanks so much for being here, uh, and for participating.

1222
01:08:21.925 --> 01:08:24.445
If you did when it came to writing intros

1223
01:08:24.445 --> 01:08:26.525
or trying it out for yourself, at this point, I'd love

1224
01:08:26.525 --> 01:08:28.165
to answer any questions people might have,

1225
01:08:28.165 --> 01:08:30.405
either about intros or about anything else.

1226
01:08:30.745 --> 01:08:34.085
Um, or if you wanna get feedback on an intro either

1227
01:08:34.145 --> 01:08:35.205
for this exercise

1228
01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:38.925
or an another intro that you've done in the past yourself,

1229
01:08:39.385 --> 01:08:41.005
I'm happy to give feedback on that as well.

1230
01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:46.125
Thank you. Um, thanks. Still.

1231
01:08:46.345 --> 01:08:47.765
So I see a question.

1232
01:08:47.765 --> 01:08:49.725
If the intro is good, how many people should stay

1233
01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:50.765
after the first 30 seconds?

1234
01:08:51.305 --> 01:08:54.245
So that question is difficult to answer mostly

1235
01:08:54.245 --> 01:08:58.165
because it depends a lot on the niche

1236
01:08:58.225 --> 01:09:00.765
and the type of video that it is.

1237
01:09:01.425 --> 01:09:05.325
Um, for instance, if you're doing like a challenge video,

1238
01:09:06.545 --> 01:09:10.445
the retention should be higher or is typically a lot higher

1239
01:09:10.445 --> 01:09:14.605
after the first 30 seconds than if you're doing let's say a

1240
01:09:15.275 --> 01:09:17.325
like a an educational video

1241
01:09:17.745 --> 01:09:19.325
for a vlog that's also different.

1242
01:09:19.325 --> 01:09:20.605
It's, it's typically gonna be higher.

1243
01:09:21.145 --> 01:09:23.725
Um, so it does depend on the video itself.

1244
01:09:25.455 --> 01:09:29.715
If I were to make a broad generalization very broadly,

1245
01:09:31.015 --> 01:09:33.315
should be at least like

1246
01:09:34.985 --> 01:09:39.315
70% blanket statement on like a really good intro.

1247
01:09:39.935 --> 01:09:42.915
You'll have like 70% after the first 30 seconds.

1248
01:09:43.015 --> 01:09:47.675
But again, it does vary massively depending on what type

1249
01:09:47.675 --> 01:09:49.435
of video you're making and what niche you're in.

1250
01:10:01.015 --> 01:10:01.705
Yeah, of course.

1251
01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:10.685
Anyone, yeah, if there are any other questions, let me know.

1252
01:10:10.825 --> 01:10:14.325
But, uh, otherwise, thank you so much for, for,

1253
01:10:14.425 --> 01:10:16.045
for being here and for participating

1254
01:10:16.065 --> 01:10:17.885
and I hope you were able to get something useful out of it.

1255
01:10:18.525 --> 01:10:21.295
This was so fantastic. Thank you so much for your time.

1256
01:10:21.555 --> 01:10:24.415
I'm sure everybody learned so much. So thank you.

1257
01:10:25.485 --> 01:10:26.235
Thank you so much.

1258
01:10:32.435 --> 01:10:33.175
Thanks, Cody.
